===============================

Parents Gateway (PG) Mobile App is an initiative by MOE to enable parents to interact with schools more conveniently on administrative and financial matters. Parents will also be able to use this app to stay updated on our school’s programmes and activities.

The PG App has been implemented in Queenstown Sec starting from 2019 onwards. If you have two or more children and they are in different schools, you will be able to receive notifications for all your children on the same PG App.

We strongly encourage all parents to download and use the PG App as it will bring significant benefits for you.
