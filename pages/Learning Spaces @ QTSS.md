<p><strong>Introduction<br></strong>Queenstown Secondary School has been
in the same site since 1957. It was rebuilt in 1997 and underwent upgrading
in 2005.</p>
<p>
<br>From 2022, the design of school spaces was reviewed with the goal of redesigning
spaces to reimagine learning and reframe teaching, as well as to enrich
the students’ schooling experience and enhance the staff’s working experience.
In addition to input and ideas from staff and students, this was done in
collaboration with MOE’s Infrastructure and Facility Services Division
School Campus Department (SCD), Learning Environments Office (LEO), English
Language and Literature Branch (ELLB), Educational Technology Division
(ETD), our School Advisory Committee (SAC), alumni, Alumni Association
and Parent Support Group (PSG).
<br>
<br><strong>Design Rationale &amp; Focus</strong>
<br>
<br>The new school spaces were redesigned to foster the following:

<p>
<br>The first wave of the reimagination work includes the replacing of the
leaking roofs from 2022 till 2024, installing a shelter across the indoor
sports hall and an international standard football pitch.
<br>
<br><strong>The School Foyer<br><br></strong>Since 2024, the school foyer
has been transformed into a welcoming space where the school community
feels at home. Every morning, Queenstownians are greeted by a scenic view
of lush greenery, which brings a motivating and energising start to the
day.
<br>
<br>This space also promotes school identity and pride. Significant moments
in the school’s history are commemorated through photo displays, while
the TVs showcase signature programmes and students’ experiences and work.
This celebration of students’ growth, successes, and voices instils a greater
sense of belonging among Queenstownians.</p>
<p>In addition, the study pods inspire a vibrant culture of learning. These
areas encourage collaboration and creativity, fostering stronger bonds
between Queenstownians.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Commons @ Quest (previously known as the School Library)</strong>
</p>
<p>The library has been transformed into an inviting and versatile space
that students are eager to visit for a range of purposes, including reading,
self-study, collaboration, meetings, peer discussion, informal social gatherings,
and activities. Apart from its bright and inviting atmosphere, it also
caters to different learning preferences, offering individual desks for
quiet study and study pods for collaborative learning with peers.
<br>
<br>The revamped library now features distinct zones designed to accommodate
multiple activities simultaneously, such as self-study and group discussions.
One key feature is the presentation zone, a platform designed for students
to engage with a wider audience in a setting similar to TED Talks. This
space hones students’ skills and confidence as they develop into more persuasive
communicators. &nbsp;Furthermore, movable bookshelves provide the flexibility
to expand or rearrange spaces as needed, ensuring the library remains adaptable
to different uses and evolving needs.
<br>
<br>As part of the redesign process, a Secondary 3 class shared their vision
for an ideal library environment. One of the key suggestions was the inclusion
of meeting spaces equipped with projection screens, allowing students to
share and express their ideas more effectively. Since the Learning Commons
@ Quest opened in 2025, it has been a popular place for students to read,
learn and collaborate. As it has been designed to be versatile venue, it
has also been used heavily for student engagement such as the Principal’s
Townhall with Secondary 3 classes, Principal’s coffee chats with parents,
Secondary 2 History Investigation interview with Alumni, Choir performance
for parents, and Chinese Dance CCA sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Green Space @ Quest (Vertical Green Wall)</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our school’s sustainability efforts, the vertical green wall
was designed in collaboration with NUS Department of Architecture. Nature
was blended with modern design to create a calm, welcoming space where
students relax and recharge, especially during recess where students do
not have access to handphones due to the school’s strict handphone policy.
<br>
<br>This space, along with the indoor green wall outside Learning Commons
@ Quest, actively support the science curriculum in the learning of environmental
sustainability and effects of greenery in enhancing the air quality and
lowering the ambient temperature. One key feature is the self-watering
system that is water-efficient through the use of rainwater, ensuring that
the plants are well-maintained and thrive.

<br><strong>Prototype Classroom</strong>
<br>
<br>The Prototype Classroom project has transformed traditional learning environments
into dynamic, flexible spaces that support collaborative learning and essential
21st-Century Competencies development. Beginning with a single classroom
and the Sustainability Hub in 2023, this initiative has evolved to encompass
three Secondary 2 classrooms in 2025, with plans for 7 additional classrooms
to be established in 2026.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Prototype_Classroom.png">
</div>
<p>The redesigned classrooms feature flexible furniture that replaces conventional
tables, enabling seamless transitions between individual work and group
collaboration. This adaptability encourages students to engage more actively
in their learning whilst developing crucial teamwork and communication
skills. The introduction of short-throw whiteboards has enhanced classroom
presentations, replacing corner-mounted projection screens with technology
that provides clearer visibility for all students and allows teachers to
annotate content effortlessly during lessons.</p>
<p>A key innovation is the mobile teacher table equipped with wireless projection
capabilities. This feature liberates educators from being confined to the
front of the classroom, enabling them to move freely amongst students to
provide personalised guidance and support. The mobility enhances teacher-student
interactions and creates a more inclusive learning environment where every
student receives attention.
<br>
<br>The project's success has paved the way for expansion in 2026, when all
seven Secondary 3 mentor classes will benefit from these enhancements.
The next phase will introduce extended whiteboard spaces specifically designed
to support homework tracking and student progress monitoring. Additionally,
side cabinets will be removed to create more spacious learning environments,
with streamlined shelving solutions maintaining storage functionality whilst
maximising floor space.</p>
<p>Complementing the classroom improvements, the entire school has undergone
lighting and ventilation upgrades. Brighter LED lighting and more DC fans
have been installed throughout, creating an environment that promotes better
focus and comfort. These enhancements improve air circulation and provide
optimal lighting conditions that support sustained learning and concentration.
The school is currently repainting all the classroom walls and replacing
all the doors with colours which have been research-based to enhance learning
readiness.</p>
<p>The Prototype Classroom project demonstrates our commitment to creating
learning spaces that adapt to modern educational needs whilst fostering
the collaborative skills and innovative thinking that students require
for future success.</p>

<p>
<br>Currently, the school is also building a study area that is co-designed
with IKEA after getting inputs from students. This is in response to students’
request for more study areas in the school. The study area will be set
up with students from our school’s TRYbe programme.
<br>
<br>Mirroring the success of the Voice of Quest, where classes take turns
to refresh the wall with messages as well as share their class experiences
using the digital screen, the school will be creating a similar wall at
level 1 to capture students’ CCA memories, progress and achievements, student
leaders, and partnerships with our various partners.
<br>
<br><strong>Other Upcoming Plans</strong>
<br>
<br>In 2026, the school will also be embarking on the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Heritage Gallery will be revamped to showcase our rich school heritage
and our Alumni. This project is made possible by the support of the National
Heritage Board and our Alumni Association.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Canteen will be renovated to create a welcoming space for the acquisition
of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies and the building of positive relationships
with teachers and schoolmates. It will also engender a deeper understanding
of health and holistic well-being. This renovation is also necessary as
the school has increased the number of food stalls to 7 stalls in 2025.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Chemistry Labs will be redesigned to support the deep learning of
Science and Chemistry concepts in an more engaging manner.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As part of the partnership with NUS, the school will continue to create
more green space. The raingarden will be enhanced to include a hydroponic
system and edible gardens to create a Farm-to-Plate experience where students
will plant and harvest edibles that can be used for cooking during Nutrition
and Food Science (NFS) lessons.
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In response to the students’ feedback, the school is working closely with
MOE to re-surface the hall’s flooring and install air-conditioning, as
well as renovate all the toilets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
