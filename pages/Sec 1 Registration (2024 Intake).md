**2024 Secondary One Registration Information**

Dear Parents/ Guardians and Secondary 1 students,

Welcome to Queenstown Secondary School (QTSS)! We are delighted to have your child/ward in our school. We have put together the necessary materials to get you started for Secondary 1 Registration Exercise.

The Secondary One Registration process will be conducted online, so the Secondary One students are&nbsp;**not required**&nbsp;to report in person on Registration Day. The designated primary contact of the child would receive a Parent Gateway (PG) notification from us, directing you to the Online Registration Portal and other relevant information from the afternoon of the S1 School Posting Day. You will be informed of your child’s form class from 29 December 2023 onwards via PG.

For further enquiries, please call the General Office at 6474 1055, or send an email to Ms Janice Han, Year Head (Lower Secondary) at han_chin_woon_janice@moe.edu.sg&nbsp;.

We trust that your child/ward will have an engaging learning experience in our school for the next 4 years. We thank you in advance for your partnership with us in your child’s/ward’s education.
