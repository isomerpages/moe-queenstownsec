We are delighted to have your child/ward in our school.

You will be informed of your child’s form class from 29 December 2023 onwards via PG.</p><p>For further enquiries, please call the General Office at 6474 1055, or send an email to Ms Janice Han, Year Head (Lower Secondary) at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">han_chin_woon_janice@moe.edu.sg</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>We trust that your child/ward will have an engaging learning experience in our school for the next 4 years.
