The ‘B’ boys were placed in a tough group with soccer powerhouses Beatty Secondary School and Serangoon Gardens Secondary School. They battled hard throughout the entire competition but were unable to progress past the group stage this year.

The ‘C’ Boys performed well in the group stage and emerged as runners up to progress into the Quarter-final. Pitted against strong opponents from Queensway Secondary School and Serangoon Gardens Secondary School, the boys fought valiantly and were unfortunate to lose out on a berth in the semi-final.
