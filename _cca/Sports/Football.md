The vision of a QTSS Footballer is one who is, and has IQ; ‘I’ for Identity and ‘Q’ for Qualities. A QTSS Footballer’s identity is firstly a **QTSS student**, followed by being a **Sportsman** before even being a **Footballer** who learns and develop the qualities of exemplary **Attitude, Behaviour and Character/Commitment (ABCs)**. 

The preparation for 2023 National School Games (NSG) started in the second half of 2022. The boys bonded together and put their heart and soul in training with the aim to bring glory to the school.  The B Division players had the privilege to play a friendly match at the iconic National Stadium. This experience of playing at the national Stadium boosted their confidence and morale.  

The post-Covid league format gave opportunities for the players to compete in more games beyond group stages. The team gave their best effort and competed fairly against their opponents demonstrating sportsmanship, commitment and the core values of respect and resilience.  

Looking ahead to the next NSG, the boys has begun to step up their training to build themselves up physically, improve individual ball skills and teamwork with the aim of going further in the league, and more importantly, to grow as a student-athlete and beyond. 

Our Motto:
ONE HEART, ONE FAMILY
