In 2023, the QTSS Basketball Team lived by their motto "Together" in an exciting season. The B division team commenced with an impressive unbeaten streak, progressing to the South Zone quarter-finals through exceptional teamwork. 
In the quarter-finals, they faced formidable opponents, securing victories but narrowly missed the semi-finals due to a single loss. Their journey was a testament to the underdog spirit, marked by unwavering determination. 
While the season didn't conclude with a fairy-tale ending, it was a year of indelible memories and strengthened bonds. The boys displayed passion, camaraderie, and learned crucial life lessons. 
Despite the outcome, 2023 was a year to cherish for the QTSS Basketball Team. Their unity and "Together" spirit will continue to drive them towards future successes, whatever challenges they may encounter.
