The training is once per week where students are taught several ways to handle the spins of the ball. They usually plays at the back of the hall and is a fun way to reduce their stress from studying.</p><p>It is important that you can respond flexibly to the incoming ball and to do that well you need to practice receiving it. Elite players will practice 1000 times on a single action so that it becomes second nature to them. This is called deliberate practice and it is the only way to enhance your performance.</p><p>Having said that, if you are not going to be an elite player, you can seek the enjoyment of playing table tennis with your friends and you can improve, albeit, very slowly through leisure games.</p>
