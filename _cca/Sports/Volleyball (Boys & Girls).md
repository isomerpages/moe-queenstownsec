With intense training thrice a week during school term and the holidays, coupled with friendly matches with other schools and participation in external competitions, our volleyball players demonstrate that sheer determination and discipline can lead to collective achievement as a team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It has been an outstanding year for QTSS Volleyball, with our ‘B’ Division girls and ‘C’ Division boys achieving 3rd place in the National School Games South zone, and our ‘C’ Division Girls’ cinching the title of South Zone Champions in 2023. Additionally, our Volleyball Boys achieved 3rd position in the Mintonette U16 Volleyball Tournament 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This is a commendable effort by the players, especially considering that 90% of them joined this CCA without any prior experience in Primary School. We also attribute our successes to our dedicated alumni, who return frequently to train with and guide their juniors. Of course, none of these achievements would have been possible without the dedication of our coaches, Coach Chen and Coach Ho.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>With exceptional teamwork and camaraderie, their strong sense of purpose fosters an environment where every player feels valued and contributes to driving the team towards victory. As we reflect on this successful year, we eagerly anticipate QTSS Volleyball achieving even greater heights in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h2><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>'B' Division Girls National School Games South Zone 3rd place &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>'C’ Division Girls National School Games South Zone 1st place</p></li><li><p>'C’ Division Boys National School Games South Zone 3rd Place &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Mintonette U16 Volleyball Tournament 2023 3rd Place&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Team motto:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Humble in Victory, Gracious in Defeat</strong></h4><p>2017 has been an unforgettable year for the Volleyball team.
