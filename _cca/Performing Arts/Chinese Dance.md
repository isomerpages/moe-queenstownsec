The Quest Dance – Chinese continues to nurture new talent with the admission of Secondary 1 members into our fold. Some of the new cohort have dance background and this adds strength to our dance troupe. In their two years with us, students develop grace and skill as dancers, assets to their future endeavours. We also strive to develop values through dance such as the importance of self- discipline and punctuality. It has been a year filled with opportunities for growth and service to the community. Here are some of the highlights.
