We affectionately call ourself the QuestBand. <br>
QuestBand consists of family members who are passionate about music and will strive to achieve our goals to the best of our ability.  
Over the years, Questband has managed to secure 5 Certificate of Distinction for the Singapore Youth Festival from 2015 to 2023. 
 
QuestBand has provided members with countless opportunities for growth, in our music competencies and character. Not only have we both hosted and participated in many exchanges with other well known schools, we have also showcased a few public performances, in particular, the Singapore Youth Festival 2023 Celebrations held at the Esplanade in July 2023. 
 
QuestBand vows to put in our one hundred and one percent in all that we do and stay united as one! With passion, we can succeed!
