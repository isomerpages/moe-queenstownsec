In 2023, we witnessed a year filled with unprecedented opportunities and exciting changes for our choir family. These changes have made us more adaptable and resilient, shaping us into a stronger ensemble. Notably, this year marked the resumption of our CCA performances after a three-year hiatus, and it was met with enthusiasm as we ventured into new territory. 

We warmly welcomed Mr. Sean Ng as our conductor, adding a valuable member to the Quest Family. Throughout the year, we seized numerous chances to perform, each contributing to our growing confidence. Our performances included a vibrant Chinese New Year celebration within our school. We also participated in a performing arts exchange where we critiqued the SYF performances of the Malay Dance and Chinese Dance teams. Additionally, we engaged in a choir exchange with Damai and Temasek Secondary School, refining our vocal skills and preparing for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2023. 

During the SYF, we sang our hearts out with renditions of "As Torrents in Summer," "Abendlied," and "Morning Rain." Our hard work and dedication earned us the Certificate of Accomplishment, marking a significant achievement. The journey did not end there, as we continued to fine-tune our vocals through various performances, both in and out of school. 

In September, we were honored to perform at the Voices of Singapore Festival (VOS) 2023, which turned out to be a sold-out concert. Songs like "Colors of the Wind" and "Always Something Sings" resonated with our audience. Furthermore, our very own Justin Lim had the privilege of conducting for the first time, adding a unique touch to our performance. 

The year 2023 has indeed been meaningful and fruitful. The Quest Choir demonstrated exceptional leadership, commitment, and perseverance in the pursuit of excellence. Equally important, we upheld the spirit of warmth and friendship, making our choir a true family. As we look ahead to 2024, our quest continues, and we are determined to achieve even greater accomplishments. We sing as one, united in our pursuit of excellence and harmony.
