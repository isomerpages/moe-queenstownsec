From January to April 2023, the Drama Club dedicated substantial effort to meticulously prepare for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). Considerable thought was invested in refining the script, enhancing props, and honing acting skills to ensure a seamless performance. Members earnestly strove to elevate the play, readily adapting parts of the script as needed. As a testament to our efforts, we were awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment for our stellar performance. 

During this period, we warmly welcomed Secondary One students who exhibited enthusiasm and passion for learning performance skills. They showcased a splendid performance during the International Friendship Day event in April, receiving widespread acclaim. 

In Semester 2, the club underwent a division into three groups, each diligently working on a short play for Racial Harmony Day. The most outstanding performance among the three was presented live in the school hall. The process involved collaborative writing in small groups of five, fostering creativity, teamwork, and refining public speaking skills. Additionally, time was allocated to individual script work, with club members annotating online scripts to enhance their understanding of when to pause or emphasize certain words. 

This proved to be a rewarding year for the Drama Club, characterized by strengthened teamwork, camaraderie, and enjoyable experiences. Beyond the theatrical realm, we diligently instilled and upheld school values through our unwavering commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
