**More Information on the CCA**
-------------------------------

Being in a Performing Art CCA during Covid 19, our dancers were greatly affected due to lack of exposure to external performances. As we moved towards post-covid era, we have heightened our involvement and the students have benefited exponentially with the rigour of the performing art scene. 

Starting with internal performances during Chinese New Year concert to Hari Raya concert and then celebrating our Queenstownian’s success during Speech Day and to round up our yearly school event, we gave an energetic dance performance during Deepavali concert. 

Our very own Questari dancers put up a great performance during SYF 2023 to bring home the Certificate of Accomplishment with the guidance of our dedicated instructor Cikgu Arif Mustafar. This performance gave the dancers the opportunity to showcase their dance on a competitive platform. We were honoured when some of our Questari dancers were invited to participate in the Opening of Singapore Youth Festival 2023 celebrations to a joint performance with our school concert band at the Esplanade Indoor Theatre. 2023 has indeed given our students an edge in the performing arena.
