2023 was a fulfilling year for the Digital Media Club. For the first time, our Secondary 4 seniors had the opportunity to step up and mentor their juniors, while teaching them the basics of photo composition. We were also keen on allowing students to use their talents in photography as a form of advocacy. As such, students got to learn from established organisations and professionals such as Nature Society (Singapore), Professional Naturalist YouTubers, and the Salvation Army. With this knowledge, they then went out to the Singapore Quarry to take photos to advocate for sustainability. <br><br>

To add, students also got to learn from a wide variety of professionals during the year. This includes learning journeys to The Gym Esportscentre to learn about broadcasting, Mothership to learn about digital journalism, and Mount Studio to experience what goes on in a professional photography studio. We also invited Jason, a guest photographer from Lianhe Zaobao, to share more about being a professional photographer. To widen their experience, the DMC also collaborated with Singapore Poly Photography Club to have a sharing session where they learnt best practices from one another. <br><br>

Finally, students also attended a portrait photography workshop titled ‘Digital Photography - Portraiture with Natural Light’ and actively took part in the annual  ‘ClickArt Showcase’ and ‘Our Schools Our Stories’ photo competition to gain valuable experience and develop excellence in photography.
