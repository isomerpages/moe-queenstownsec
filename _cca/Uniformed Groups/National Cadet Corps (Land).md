In 2023, NCC continued to expose cadets to various external competitions and community outreaches. One of highlights was #OurHendersonDawson National Day Carnival, where our cadets participated in a parade commemorating National Day at the newly renovated Delta Sports Complex. Together with the students from the school’s choir who put up song performances, our cadets exemplified the school motto, ‘Dare to Serve’ with pride as they helped reinforce our national consciousness and identity amongst the community during the event. Even though this was the fourth time we are participating in the event, it was the first time for many of our cadets to be taking part in an external event representing NCC. 
 
Our Senior Cadet Leaders also had the chance to demonstrate and hone their leadership capabilities by conducting the annual unit camp, Camp TENDO, once again. This was the first time since Covid that we had an overnight camp, and our cadets had a good time of building teamwork, relationships, and resilience as they learnt to stretch their capacities under pressure during the two-day-one-night camp. 
 
Our Senior Cadets also had a rare opportunity to take part in the One-star Kayaking certification course conducted by HQNCC. Usually only offered to NCC (Sea) cadets, our Land cadets gained water confidence and learnt to work together as a team to overcome difficulties faced in the waters. Although not all the participants attained the one-star kayaking certificate by the end of the course, they had challenged themselves to step out of their comfort zone and learnt to thread in unfamiliar medium. 
 
This year, we also had a record number of cadets who attained their Precision Drill Squad (PDS) Basic Certification. We attribute this to the cadets’ increased commitment to and passion in PDS, as we saw an unprecedented culture of positive peer encouragement and influence to strive for PDS excellence amongst the cadets. 
 
The Senior Cadet (Sec 1) Captain’s Ball team is also worthy of mention as they had managed to enter the semi-finals in the HQNCC West District Sport Championship, even though they did not have any formal training in the game. However, what was even more commendable was the sterling sportsmanship they exhibited when they agreed to enter a crucial sudden death match after the opposing team challenged the referee’s decision to award the winning point to our team. Although they lost the sudden death match in the end and also the chance to enter finals, the show of character was an achievement in itself and was nothing less than outstanding. 
 
We look forward to more opportunities next year for outdoor activities and experiential learning.  
 
To Serve with Pride and Dedication!
