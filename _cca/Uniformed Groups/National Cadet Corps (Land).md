QTSS NCC (Land) is a cadet-centric Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), where every cadet is a self-motivated leader, with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart. Through fun and challenging military-related activities, we strive to develop resourceful, responsible, resilient, loyal leaders and team players.

Cadets are trained to develop resilient minds, so that they will be confident to take on challenges and overcome setbacks. They are trained towards achieving a fit body, such that they understand the importance of fitness, take ownership to maintain a good level of physical fitness and adopt healthy eating habits. Cadets should have a committed heart and live by the NCC core values (i.e. loyalty to country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility, care for fellow cadets, adventurous spirit, and safety). They should have a strong sense of purpose to serve their team, school and nation and be passionate towards developing their own abilities.

At the end of their journey, our cadets should be able to proudly declare that they are here, “To serve with pride and dedication.”
