The Queenstown Secondary School NPCC Unit focuses on six core values (P.I.C.A.R.D), namely Punctuality, Integrity, Commitment, Attitude, Resilience and Discipline in every endeavour of our cadets. These values will bring our cadets through their four or five years in NPCC, developing them into active leaders within the unit as well as in the community.

Our NPCC unit has yet again done the school proud by attaining Silver in the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) 2016, exhibiting the value of excellence through the hard work of the cadets, Cadet Inspectors and Teacher Officers. Our cadets have been involved in many Values in Action (VIA) projects such as SummeRice and Project K.A.N in collaboration with the Community.

Through these projects, the cadets learnt to care for the needy and also the value of team work. Together with Queenstown Neighbourhood Police Centre, we helped to spread awareness of SG Secure by setting up information booths in school and also interacting with the residents within Queenstown vicinity. The cadets also benefit from various enrichment courses such as 1-Star Kayaking, DNA in Forensics Science and Community Emergency Preparedness Program. The Unit aspires to become a Gold Unit which offers cadets the best of learning experiences.
