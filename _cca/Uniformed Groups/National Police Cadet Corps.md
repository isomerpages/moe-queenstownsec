<h2><strong>More Information on the CCA</strong></h2>
<p>Queenstown Secondary School's NPCC (National Police Cadet Corps) unit
mission is to nurture cadets into <strong>disciplined, compassionate</strong> individuals
who are prepared for a lifetime of <strong>leadership and service</strong>,
with a focus on <strong>six core values</strong> (P.I.C.A.R.D), namely Punctuality,
Integrity, Commitment, Attitude, Resilience and Discipline. &nbsp;The unit
achieves this through a focus on resilience, teamwork, and integrity, supported
by a variety of activities.</p>
<p>Cadets are trained to face challenges head-on and develop <strong>mental and emotional strength</strong>.
through rigorous physical training, problem-solving activities, and exposure
to real-life scenarios, such as <strong>camps, .22 Revolver Shoot and Unarmed Tactics.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>To foster a sense of camaraderie and mutual support that are essential <strong>for effective teamwork</strong>,
cadets participate in group activities, <strong>camps,</strong> and <strong>drills </strong>that
require cooperation and collaboration to strengthen their ability to work
as a cohesive unit.</p>
<p>Cadets are taught to uphold <strong>strong moral principles</strong> and
act with <strong>honesty and fairness</strong> in all situations. This is
reinforced through various roles and responsibilities that require them
to make ethical decisions. The cadets also undergo <strong>leadership training</strong> such
as the <strong>Leadership Mentorship Skills Course</strong> and <strong>Cadet Leader Course</strong> to
develop their leadership potential.</p>
<p>Activities such as <strong>Police Knowledge sessions</strong>, <strong>Crime Scene Investigation</strong> training,
and <strong>Visits to Police Institutions</strong> provide cadets with a <strong>deeper understanding of law enforcement work</strong> and
the importance of <strong>integrity</strong> in their duties. The <strong>Police Youth Ambassador Programme</strong> offer
opportunities for cadets to <strong>engage with the community</strong> to
spread awareness on security and safety.</p>
<p>Through the hard work of our cadets, Cadet Inspectors, Honorary Officers
and Teacher Officers, our NPCC unit has done the school proud to achieve
the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) Gold / Distinction from 2017
to 2023, exhibiting the <strong>value of excellence.</strong>
