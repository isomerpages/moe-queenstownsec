As we march into 100 years of guiding in Singapore, Queenstown guides are reflective of our role and place in this ever-changing and complex world today. One example is preparing our Guides to champion the SGSecure movement in school.

Not forgetting the core values that built our strong history, our holistic training programmes need to help ensure that such values are deeply anchored in our Guides as we cross the new frontier. Through our weekly activities, Guides continue to learn relevant and important skills to help prepare them for the future.
