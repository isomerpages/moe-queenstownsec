“Be Prepared” is the motto of all Scouts. Each scout is trained to be prepared while carrying out scouting activities e.g. outdoor cooking, pioneering, kayaking, camping, sailing, doing community service.

Scouting builds character, social skills, leadership skills and life skills in all scouts. It also allows promising scouts to attain the pinnacle award (Chief Commissioner’s Award) in the scout section.

The scouts are able to come this far, and learn and grow this much with the extra care, help and blessing from the following people:

*   Old boys that put in considerable time and effort for all the troop’s activities;
*   Parents that never fail to lend their helping hand and give words of encouragement to their children, and,
*   South Area commissioners from The Singapore Scout Association for their dedication and support in youth leadership and development.

With such strong support, the troop will only grow stronger in spirit and strength. Queenstown03 Scouts forever!
