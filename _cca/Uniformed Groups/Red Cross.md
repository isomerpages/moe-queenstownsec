The Singapore Red Cross Society seeks to nurture cadets with a greater heart for humanity and to equip every cadet with lifelong skills in relieving human suffering and protecting lives. Such is done through exposure opportunities including the World First Aid Day, Blood and Food Donation Drive, Flag Day and visit to the Lion Befrienders Elderly Home.

Our cadets have also displayed excellence by clinching our first Gold in the 2017 National First Aid Competition for the senior category and Bronze for the junior category. Months of intense training have certainly paid off. We were also awarded the Excellent Unit Award (EUA) Gold in March.
