Design and Innovation
=====================

**Teachers-in-Charge**

The aim of D&amp;I club is as follow: <br>
(1) To cultivate the habit of making, tinkering, iterating and creating, by our students. <br>
(2) To shift their mindset from that of consuming, to that of creating. <br>
(3) To cultivate their sensitivity to opportunities for design that improves the lives of others and themselves. <br><br>
The pathways that allow these outcome to materialize, are via our three key programs:  
(1) Microbit learning where students learn coding to control a microprocessor that can perfom many tasks. <br>
(2) 3D printing where students make use of CAD drawing (computer aided design) such as Tinkercad, to generate prototype in PLA (polylactic acid) material. <br>
(3) Traditional hands-on making, using cardboard, acrylic, wood, recycle material, to create products. 
The lower secondary classes are taught Micro-bit and 3D printing via vendor support, while upper secondary classes engage in both teacher led projects and self-initiated projects, after gaining experience from the lower secondary learning.  
Our club sessions are held every Wednesday afternoon, in the Design studios.
