The ICT Club in Queenstown Secondary School is made up of 3 sub-units: the Infocomm Club, the AV Club and the Photography & Digital Media Club. With 6 teachers in-charge about 40 dedicated members, we are the driving force of the school’s passion in ICT, videography, photography and audio-visual.

The Infocomm Club members meet on a weekly-basis to work on skills in software, game creation and animation. Under the watchful eyes of an Infocomm-trainer, we also take part in annual competitions such as the Schools Digital Media Awards (SDMA).  
The Audio-Visual (AV) Club is instrumental in the school’s daily operations and events. They work hard behind the scenes to give professional audio and visual support. This ensures a smooth operation at the back stage, allowing performers to give their best on stage. Besides audio, the crew enhances performances with lighting effects. With the combination of light and sound, the AV team provides a sensory treat for the audiences.  
The Photography Club has expanded its scope in order to better equip its members with the demands of tertiary education once they graduate. With the infusion of Digital Media elements, members of the Photography Club is learning the skills to design posters, video-making as well as photo editing. With these skills, our students will be able to create better opportunities and products for themselves, school and even their chosen industry.

**InfoComm Club members are given the opportunities to participate in numerous IT-related competitions annually.**
