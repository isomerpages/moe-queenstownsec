Our club consists of 34 members: 9 Sec 1; 12 Sec 2; 12 Sec 3 and 10 Sec 4 students. Strategy Games Club aims to build and sharpen decision making skills through playing of strategy games specifically scrabble and chess. We engaged established trainers from the Scrabble Academy and Accredited Chess Trainers to conduct trainings for our students. Students were taught innovative and up-to-date strategies in both scrabble and chess by the trainers. Our trainings are held on every Wednesdays afternoon in ITR2. 

Competitions:
Every year, we participate in national and zonal scrabble competitions to compete with other schools for the championship titles. This year, for the Super Zonal Competition 2023 in March 2023, we sent two teams, one team for C division and one team for B division. Our B division won the championship and the C division put up a good fight. 
In September, we send four teams, 2 teams for B division and 2 teams for C division for the Super Zonal Scrabble (SZS) 2023 on 7th September. 
Our C division Team 1 and B division Team 1 won the south division championship titles respectively.
