<p><strong><u>Principal’s Message 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a Thriving QTSS Community to Nurture Flourishing Learners and Future-Oriented Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear QTSS Community,</p>
<p>It gives me immense pride and joy to share our school’s progress and aspirations
as we foster a nurturing environment where Queenstownians can learn, grow
and thrive. At the heart of our work is a shared vision of cultivating <strong>Leaders for Tomorrow, </strong>who
are<strong> Anchored in Values </strong>and<strong> Committed to Serve.</strong> Every
initiative that we embark on is guided by this purpose, as we equip Queenstownians
for success academically, socially and emotionally. My colleagues’ efforts
in implementing our strategic initiatives have led to stellar progress
in our academic and co-curricular outcomes, which I have shared regularly
in my termly letters to parents.</p>
<p>This is the start of my 4<sup>th</sup> year in Queenstown Secondary School
and I would like to highlight the school’s key efforts in building a Thriving
QTSS Community, Flourishing Learners and Future-Oriented Leaders and I
invite you to visit our school website for the detailed updates.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment to Engaged Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>In a fast-moving world of learning and working, we recognise the importance
of providing a holistic education that orients our Queenstownians for the
future. As such, we have been steadily evolving our curriculum as well
as our teaching and learning practices to engage our students in their
learning. Our <strong>Total Curriculum </strong>integrates academic excellence
with character and citizenship<strong> </strong>education, placing<strong> </strong>a
deliberate emphasis on developing 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies (21CC)
such as adaptive thinking and effective communication.</p>
<p>Since 2022, the school has embarked on a journey to reimagine learning
spaces so as to support engaged learning for our Queenstownians. Some of
the <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/learning-spaces-qtss/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reimagined physical spaces</a></strong> include
the upgraded school foyer, library, indoor sports hall as well as the introduction
of prototype classrooms. Coupled with the enhanced use of educational technology,
and the forward-looking <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/futurelearn-curriculum/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FutureLearn Curriculum</a></strong>,
we are creating authentic opportunities for Queenstownians to learn, explore,
and flourish in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.</p>
<p><strong>Stretching Potential through Talent Development</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every student is a unique individual with strengths and potential
waiting to be discovered. To nurture these talents, we offer targeted programmes
such as <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/talent-development/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">subject-based talent development</a></strong> plans
and the <strong>QUEST Global programme</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2024, we expanded our students’ horizons with enriching trips to Vietnam
and Thailand, underscoring our dedication to providing Queenstownians with
international exposure. Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we plan to extend
these opportunities to countries such as Japan, Indonesia, and China.</p>
<p>These experiences not only cultivate 21CC but also allow our students
to build friendships across borders, appreciate the unique strengths and
opportunities of other countries, and gain a global perspective. Upon returning
to Singapore, our Queenstownians carry with them a renewed appreciation
for Singapore’s role as a global hub and a strengthened resolve to contribute
to the nation’s continued growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Nurturing Growth through Student Well-being</strong>
</p>
<p>Student well-being remains as the cornerstone of meaningful and effective
learning. Our <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/student-development/student-well-being/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Well-being Framework</a></strong> is
dedicated to fostering a culture of care and connection by nurturing supportive
relationships among students, teachers, and the wider community.</p>
<p>Through our Community Youth Leadership initiatives, Queenstownians engage
in meaningful projects that extend beyond the classroom, making positive
contributions to the society. I am proud of their achievements, as <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scrunchies-pouches-keychains-students-make-items-to-raise-funds-for-st-school-pocket-money-fund" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted in The Straits Times</a>.
By prioritising emotional resilience, mental health and helping students
find meaning in their lives, we empower our Queenstownians to face challenges
with confidence and courage.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Harnessing the Power of Partnership</strong>
</p>
<p>Our shared success is made possible by the strong partnerships between
our school, parents, alumni, industry leaders such as IKEA, Singapore Hilton
Hotels, Rockwell Automation, Abbott Manufacturing, City Development Limited,
Elsie’s Kitchen, The Polyolefin Company, ASTAR Singapore, Elmich Ptd Ltd,
as well as Educational Partners such as NUS, NP and the wider community.
Our Alumni Association<strong> </strong>has also stepped forward to provide <strong>Career Mentoring</strong> for
Queenstownians, offering timeless and timely advice on career guidance.</p>
<p>Many of these partnerships have been fostered through our <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/student-development/school-home-collaboration/parent-support-group/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Parent Support Group</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/quest-alumni/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alumni Association</a></strong>,
and <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/school-advisory-committee/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">School Advisory Committee</a></strong>,
enabling the school to offer a meaningful and impactful <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/student-development/ecg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Educational Career Guidance Programme</a></strong> for
our Queenstownians. Your unwavering support has been instrumental in creating
an ecosystem where every Queenstownian can thrive, realise their fullest
potential and graduate with the confidence that they can contribute to
the betterment of others, embodying our school’s motto of Berani Berkhidmat.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>We have embarked on a remarkable journey of transformation and while we
celebrate our achievements, our focus remains firmly on the road ahead.
With your continued partnership, I am confident that we, as a <strong>thriving QTSS Community</strong>,
will continue to nurture our Queenstownians to be<strong> flourishing learners </strong>and<strong> future-oriented leaders </strong>(Find
