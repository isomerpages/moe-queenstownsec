<h3><strong>Principal's Message 2026</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Celebrating Our Milestone</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Dear QTSS Community,</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we approach our 70th anniversary, we stand at a meaningful moment in
Queenstown Secondary School’s rich story. This milestone invites us to
honour our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/discover-quest/history" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">shared heritage</a>,
celebrate our progress, and recommit ourselves to our school motto, Berani
Berkhidmat, Dare to Serve. As I begin my fifth year with the school, I
am proud to highlight how we, with the support and partnership of our parents,
are nurturing our <strong>Thriving QTSS Community, Flourishing Learners and Future-Oriented Leaders</strong>:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Thriving QTSS Community: A Place to Belong</strong>
</p>
<p>Our commitment to a Thriving QTSS Community is anchored in our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/learning-spaces-qtss/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">re-imagined learning spaces</a>,
which intentionally shape environments to foster belonging, connection,
and engagement: The refreshed school foyer welcomes every Queenstownian
with greenery and visual reminders of our shared story, while the new Learning
Commons offers flexible zones for study, collaboration and presentations,
encouraging meaningful interactions and peer learning. This year, the Prototype
Classroom will expand to include seven additional classrooms, further transforming
traditional spaces into dynamic environments that support collaborative
learning and the development of essential 21st Century Competencies. These
efforts are strengthened by our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/student-development/student-well-being/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Well-Being Framework</a>,
and by the strong partnerships we share with staff, parents, alumni and
partners, especially our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/quest-community/parent-support-group/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parent Support Group</a>,
<a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/quest-community/quest-alumni-association/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Alumni Association</a>, and <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/quest-community/school-advisory-committee/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">School Advisory Committee</a>.
Together, we foster a community where every Queenstownian feels known,
supported, and safe to grow while building positive relationships grounded
in care and gratitude.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Flourishing Learners: Purposeful Learning and Growth</strong>
</p>
<p>To optimise these redesigned spaces, we continue to strengthen teaching
and learning approaches, leveraging on Educational Technology tools, that
stretch students while providing timely support and space for students
to Learn – Do – Reflect. At the heart of our work to nurture Flourishing
Learners is our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/total-curriculum/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Total Curriculum</a>,
which integrates academic learning, character development and future-ready
competencies, so that our students become self-directed, joyful in learning
and committed with a positive self-concept based on their unique worth.
We continue to embed 21st-Century Competencies and future literacies so
that our students are well prepared for an ever-changing world of learning
and work. Key to this is our long-established <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/quick-links/school-links/applied-learning-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</a> in
Environmental Sustainability, where students engage with real-world issues
and build environmental responsibility. Complementing the ALP is our Learning
for Life Programme in <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/quick-links/school-links/learning-for-life-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community Youth Leadership (CYL)</a>,
which intentionally cultivates service, care, and social awareness. Additionally,
through our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/student-development/ecg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Educational and Career Guidance (ECG) programme</a>,
strengthened by strategic partnerships, Queenstownians gain authentic exposure
to industry, post-secondary pathways and real-world contexts that help
them make informed aspirations and choices. Together with <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/full-subject-based-banding-full-sbb/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Full Subject‑Based Banding</a>,
our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/talent-development/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Talent Development Programme</a> and
these partnership-enabled ECG experiences, we support each Queenstownian
in exploring their interests, developing their strengths, and charting
a learning journey suited to their talents and aspirations while embracing
a growth mindset.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Future-Oriented Leaders: Serving Others and Our Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Indeed, across these experiences, Queenstownians are encouraged to look
beyond themselves, beyond school, and beyond now. CYL projects, environmental
efforts and service-learning initiatives help them put our <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/about-us/discover-quest/school-vision/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">core values</a> of
Resilience, Respect, Integrity, Care and Excellence into action. Through
the <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/quest-global/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">QUEST Global</a> programme,
students extend their learning beyond our local context, engaging with
international perspectives, collaborating with peers across borders, and
applying their learning in authentic global and community settings. These
global experiences, combined with our purposeful school-based initiatives,
help students deepen empathy, expand cultural awareness and strengthen
their ability to navigate complexity. Our <strong><a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/futurelearn-curriculum/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FutureLearn Curriculum</a></strong> further
develops their 21st Century Competencies and future literacies, preparing
them to be empathetic, forward-thinking, and adaptable leaders who can
take effective action in an uncertain world<strong>.</strong> &nbsp;In doing
so, as future-oriented leaders, our Queenstownians are encouraged not only
to dream for themselves, but to contribute meaningfully to society through
serving others, caring for the environment, and shaping a better future
for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Join Us in the 70th Anniversary Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>As we prepare to celebrate seven decades of history, heritage and progress,
I invite every member of our QTSS community—past, present and future—to
renew our shared commitment: to belong, to grow, and to serve. Our alumni
from the founding year of 1956 pioneered the establishment of one of the
first local secondary school Alumni Associations (see <a href="https://www.queenstownsec.moe.edu.sg/media-highlights/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
the article published in Zaobao, alongside its English translation), and
their continued commitment to giving back exemplifies the enduring spirit
of service and pursuit of excellence that defines our school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mark this significant milestone, we are supporting our Alumni Association
to host a Gala Night on 23 May, which will be honoured by the presence
of our distinguished alumnus, Mr Desmond Tan (Class of 1986), Senior Minister
of State at the Prime Minister's Office. Additionally, we are working alongside
Henderson-Dawson People's Association to organise a National Day Fiesta
on 15 August (tentative) at our school premises, celebrating seven decades
of our role within the Queenstown Community and our contributions to nation-building.
We warmly invite you to participate in these celebrations!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your continued support, partnership and belief in our mission will anchor
our journey forward. Let us continue building a Thriving Community, nurturing
Flourishing Learners, and shaping Future-Oriented Leaders who are Leaders
for Tomorrow, Anchored in Values, and Committed to Serve. Thank you for
your journey with us as we continue to write our school’s story! (Find
