The QUEST Journey
============

**Chapter 1: Our Beginning (1956 – 1959)**

Queenstown Secondary Technical School (QSTS) started in 1956 as an all-boys technical school. It was first housed in Jalan Eunos School while the new school premise was being built. In January 1957, the 1st cohort excitedly moved in with 343 students in Secondary one and two, stepping into a new future. Till this day, the school stands proudly at its original location at 1 Strathmore Road. 

In 1959, all 92 of our first batch of students sat for the 1959 General Certificate of Education Examinations. Of all the students who sat for the Cambridge School Certificate Examination, 80% passed. Though technical facilities were still lacking, such as lathes and workshop benches, our boys continued to hone their technical skills with the little resources at hand, determined to do their best as the school continued to push ahead with the technical curriculum, embodying our QUEST spirit of resilience and excellence.

**Chapter 2: Our Growth (1960 – 1977)**

The improvements to the school in the early 1960s, such as the addition of new classrooms, some of them doubling up as the library and reading rooms, created a better learning environment for the students.  We achieved a significant milestone in 1965 with the establishment of a Pre-University class, opening new pathways to higher education at the Polytechnic, a move which encapsulates our QUEST for learning and excellence.

This quest bore fruit when , Ang Hock Chye, a standout student in the early years, was awarded the Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Scholarship, now known as the President’s Scholarship, in 1964. In 1966, Lee Yock Suan, who scored 7 distinctions, became the second Queenstownian to be awarded the President’s scholarship. He went on to a Public Service career and served as a Cabinet Minister from 1981 till 2004. Several others in the cohort were also awarded prestigious scholarships like the Colombo Plan Scholarships and the Commonwealth Scholarships. 

With its focus on academic excellence, Queenstown Secondary Technical School was highly sought after. To accommodate our growing pool of learners, the addition of a 4-storey building, a hall-cum-canteen, and 4 Science Laboratories were completed on 2 April 1968. The Minister of Education, Mr Ong Pang Boon, officially declared the new extensions open, marking another milestone in our QUEST for learning and excellence.

1971 saw the admission of girls into our school, making Queenstown Secondary Technical School a co-education school from then onwards. In the GCE ‘O’ Level in 1974, all 5 top students were from this batch of female pioneers. Two joined the National Junior College (NJC) while the other three opted to remain in Queenstown over placements in NJC.

The first Student’s Council was formed with 12 members in 1976. New facilities were added to the school in 1977 in the form of two basketball courts in the field, one volleyball court between the two workshops, ten table-tennis tables made of concrete and nine wooden tables in the hall. Queenstownian Mui Chee Wai did the school proud by being the only candidate to secure a P1 distinction for Basic Electricity. He continued his studies in the United Kingdom. 

**Chapter 3: Our Partnerships (1977 – 1989)**

In 1977, the Alumni Association was set up. A group of the initial batch of 1959 graduate students, led by Queenstownian Mr Tan Wee Tin,  having established successful careers of their own, stepped up with a mission to give back to the alma mater. The Alumni Association , was the first local secondary school alumni to be officially registered with the Registrar of Society (ROS), establishing a legacy of support that endures to this day, significantly contributing to our Quest for learning and excellence. 

Soon after, the School Executive Committee was formed in 1983, providing an additional pillar of support. The Committee supported the upgrades and improvements to the school facilities, enhancing the learning environment, such as the air-conditioning of the Library that was officially declared open by Goh Kim Leong, Permanent Secretary (Education/Director of Education) in 1984. The School Executive Committee and the Ministry of Education jointly funded the Computer Laboratory upgrade with 26 personal computers. Language learning, in the new Language Laboratory, also benefitted with more investments like the teacher’s console and the 48 students’ booths. These new learning developments were officially opened in conjunction with our Speech Day in August 1985 by our Alumnus Guest of Honour, Mr Lee Yock Suan, then Acting Minister of Labour. 

In 1988, our school was among the few secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to provide CoRT Thinking and Pastoral Care &amp; Career Guidance to our students. In November that same year, we launched a 3-day seminar for Secondary 1-3 students to participate in the ‘Growth Through Shared Responsibilities’ workshops, to top off our participation in this national program. Pastoral Care &amp; Career Guidance continues to be one of the school’s key focus, to develop our students’ positive self-concept and provide opportunities to explore different industries and discover their unique talents.

In December 1993, the school moved out of the premises in Strathmore Avenue to a temporary site at 369 Commonwealth Avenue. This is to make way for the demolition of the old buildings and the construction of new buildings with up-to-date facilities. The new school is scheduled for completed in April 1997. The school has shifted back to its new building since June 1997 and is now functioning as a single session school.

In January 1997, the school was amongst the 20 pilot schools selected for the Thinking Programme by the Ministry of Education. The school also started on the Peer Tutoring/Group Study programme for pupils in Secondary 4 and 5 in Science and Mathematics in 1997.

In December 1994, our last batch of Pre-U pupils completed their education in Queenstown Secondary School. We are pleased that our last batch of Pre-U pupils did well in their GCE ‘A’ Level Examinations.

To date, 14 Principals and 12 Vice-principals have served the school. We have come a long way since 1956 when we started with only 116 pupils in three secondary classes and 227 pupils in six secondary classes, 15 teachers, 5 clubs and 1 uniformed group in borrowed premises.

We have excelled in both the academic field and extra-curricular activities. Keeping up with times, the school has been renamed Queenstown Secondary School since 1 January 1993.

The new school building and the QUEST Museum were officially opened by Mr Lee Yock Suan, Minister For Information and the Arts and Minister for the Environment on 9 July 1999.
