<h1>The QUEST Journey</h1>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Our Beginning (1956 – 1959)</strong>
</p>
<p>Queenstown Secondary Technical School (QSTS) started in 1956 as an all-boys
technical school, being one of the [first technical schools in Singapore](https://www.roots.gov.sg/places/places-landing/Places/landmarks/my-queenstown-heritage-trail/queenstown-secondary-school). It was first housed in Jalan Eunos School while the new
school premise was being built. In January 1957, the 1st cohort excitedly
moved in with 343 students in Secondary one and two, stepping into a new
future. Till this day, the school stands proudly at its original location
at 1 Strathmore Road.</p>
<p>In 1959, all 92 of our first batch of students sat for the 1959 General
Certificate of Education Examinations. Of all the students who sat for
the Cambridge School Certificate Examination, 80% passed. Though technical
facilities were still lacking, such as lathes and workshop benches, our
boys continued to hone their technical skills with the little resources
at hand, determined to do their best as the school continued to push ahead
with the technical curriculum, embodying our QUEST spirit of resilience
and excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Our Growth (1960 – 1977)</strong>
</p>
<p>The improvements to the school in the early 1960s, such as the addition
of new classrooms, some of them doubling up as the library and reading
rooms, created a better learning environment for the students. We achieved
a significant milestone in 1965 with the establishment of a Pre-University
class, opening new pathways to higher education at the Polytechnic, a move
which encapsulates our QUEST for learning and excellence.</p>
<p>This quest bore fruit when Ang Hock Chye, a standout student in the early
years, was awarded the Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Scholarship, now known as
the President’s Scholarship, in 1964. In 1966, Lee Yock Suan, who scored
7 distinctions, became the second Queenstownian to be awarded the President’s
scholarship. He went on to a Public Service career and served as a Cabinet
Minister from 1981 to 2004. Several others in the cohort were also awarded
prestigious scholarships like the Colombo Plan Scholarships and the Commonwealth
Scholarships.</p>
<p>With its focus on academic excellence, Queenstown Secondary Technical
School was highly sought after. To accommodate our growing pool of learners,
the addition of a 4-storey building, a hall-cum-canteen, and 4 Science
Laboratories were completed on 2 April 1968. The Minister of Education,
Mr Ong Pang Boon, officially declared the new extensions open, marking another milestone in our QUEST for learning and excellence.</p>

<p>1971 saw the admission of girls into our school, making Queenstown Secondary
Technical School a co-education school from then onwards. In the GCE ‘O’
Level in 1974, all 5 top students were from this batch of female pioneers.
Two joined the National Junior College (NJC) while the other three opted
to remain in Queenstown over placements in NJC.</p>
<p>The first Student’s Council was formed with 12 members in 1976. New facilities
were added to the school in 1977 in the form of two basketball courts in
the field, one volleyball court between the two workshops, ten table-tennis
tables made of concrete and nine wooden tables in the hall. Queenstownian
Mui Chee Wai did the school proud by being the only candidate to secure
a P1 distinction for Basic Electricity. He continued his studies in the
United Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Our Partnerships (1977 – 1989)</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1977, the Alumni Association was set up. A group of the initial batch
of 1959 graduate students, led by Queenstownian Mr Tan Wee Tin, having
established successful careers of their own, stepped up with a mission
to give back to the alma mater. The Alumni Association was the first local
secondary school alumni to be officially registered with the Registrar
of Society (ROS), establishing a legacy of support that endures to this
day, and have tirelessly contributed to our Quest for learning and excellence.</p>
<p>Soon after, the School Executive Committee was formed in 1983, providing
an additional pillar of support. The Committee supported the upgrades and
improvements to the school facilities, enhancing the learning environment,
such as the air-conditioning of the Library that was officially declared
open by Goh Kim Leong, Permanent Secretary (Education/Director of Education)
in 1984. The School Executive Committee and the Ministry of Education jointly
funded the Computer Laboratory upgrade with 26 personal computers. Language
learning, in the new Language Laboratory, also benefitted with more investments
like the teacher’s console and the 48 students’ booths. These new learning
developments were officially opened in conjunction with our Speech Day
in August 1985 by our Alumnus Guest of Honour, Mr Lee Yock Suan, then Acting
Minister of Labour.</p>
<p>In 1988, our school was among the few secondary schools selected by the
Ministry of Education to provide CoRT Thinking and Pastoral Care &amp;
Career Guidance to our students. In November that same year, we launched
a 3-day seminar for Secondary 1-3 students to participate in the ‘Growth
Through Shared Responsibilities’ workshops, to top off our participation
in this national program. Pastoral Care &amp; Career Guidance continues
to be one of the school’s key areas of focus, to develop our students’
positive self-concept and provide opportunities to explore different industries
and discover their unique talents.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Our New Identity (1990 – 1999)</strong>
</p>
<p>In January 1993, Queenstown Secondary Technical School (QSTS) was renamed
Queenstown Secondary School (QTSS). Though dropping ‘Technical’ from the
school’s name was in keeping with the times, it brought disappointment
and sadness to the pioneering cohort. They represented the ‘Technical’
era that produced many outstanding students, many of whom are still contributing
actively to our society. They are the epitome of “Berani Berkhidmat - Dare
to Serve”, powerhouses who helped Singapore shine through the industrialization
years. The transition to QTSS represented not an ending, but a renewal
of the school’s pioneering tradition, carrying forward the same dedication
to technical excellence while embracing broader education horizons. The
acronym ‘QUEST’, originally an abbreviation of Queenstown Secondary Technical,
continues to embody our enduring spirit of exploration, excellence and
enterprise.</p>
<p>Together with the name change, the school also moved out of the premises
in Strathmore Avenue to a temporary site at Commonwealth Avenue for a major
upgrade to the school premise. This involved the complete teardown and
rebuilding of the new school compound.</p>
<p>In December 1994, our last batch of Pre-U students completed their education
in Queenstown Secondary School. This was in lieu of the Ministry direction
to consolidate ‘A’ level curriculum under the Junior Colleges. This last
batch of Pre-U students did very well in their GCE ‘A’ Level Examinations.</p>
<img src="/images/Discover%20Quest/History%203.png" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-left:15px;" align="right">
<p>In January 1997, the school was amongst the 20 pilot schools selected for the Thinking Programme by the Ministry of Education. The school also started on the Peer Tutoring/Group Study programme for students in Secondary 4 and 5 in Science
and Mathematics in 1997.</p>


<p>By April 1997, the new school was completed and ready for students in
June. Once again, an excited batch of students marched happily into the
new school compound back to its original home ground, at Strathmore Road.
The new school building and the QUEST Museum were officially opened by
our Alumnus, Mr Lee Yock Suan, Minister for Information and the Arts and
Minister for the Environment on 9 July 1999.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Our Advancements (2000 – 2020)</strong>
</p>
<p>The new millennium brought exciting developments to Queenstown Secondary
School. In 2000, the school launched Project Cabin, establishing a permanent
and welcoming space for the after-school programme. This initiative proved
instrumental in developing students' social and leadership skills, building
their unique strengths and teaching them to serve others in tangible ways,
all while also providing crucial support for youth at risk and students
needing additional assistance.</p>
<p>In 2007, the school underwent the Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving
Existing Schools (PRIME), resulting in significant infrastructure enhancements.
The upgrading brought modern facilities including an Indoor Sports Hall,
additional computer laboratories, upgraded science laboratories, a more
spacious school hall, expanded study areas, and larger classrooms to enhance
the learning environment. A ceremony was held on 23 March 2010 to officially
mark the completion of the project.</p>
<p>Building on this improved infrastructure, the school introduced the Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) in Environmental Sustainability in 2014, equipping
students with the knowledge and skills to foster a culture of environmental
responsibility and empower our students to become stewards of a more sustainable
future. In 2015, the school launched its Learning for Life Programme (LLP)
focusing on Community Youth Leadership, helping students develop strong
leadership capabilities through community service, embodying the school
motto – Berani Berkhidmat! These programmes capture the Quest spirit in
action – nurturing future-oriented leaders who dare to innovate and serve.
Students learn to identify community needs, generate innovate solutions,
and take effective action for positive change. This reflects our belief
that every Queenstownian can be empowered to excel and contribute meaningfully
to society.</p>
<p>Another significant milestone was reached in 2016 when the school celebrated
its 60th anniversary with a grand homecoming dinner attended by hundreds
of alumni. In 2017, the school was selected as one of the pilot schools
for the Student Learning Space (SLS), with the Mother Tongue Language department
leading the way in implementing this new digital learning platform. This
early adoption of digital learning proved particularly valuable when the
COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, enabling the school to smoothly transition
to home-based learning while maintaining its educational standards.</p>
<p>**Chapter 6: Our Present **</p>
<p>In 2020, the school was selected to be one of the 28 pilot schools for
Full Subject-Based Banding programme. This programme exemplified our Quest
for learning and excellence, enabling students maximise their potential
in multiple disciplines, experience the joy of learning, and develop their
capacity to contribute meaningfully to community and society.</p>
<p>In 2022, the school embarked on an ambitious space redesign initiative,
collaborating with various MOE divisions, the School Advisory Committee
and Alumni Association to reimagine learning spaces. This comprehensive
review aimed to enhance both the students' learning experience and staff's
working environment, demonstrating the school's commitment to creating
innovative and effective learning environments. Most importantly, it represents
the school’s goal to orient students to the joy of learning and be oriented
towards the future.</p>
<p>Throughout these years, Queenstown Secondary School maintained its reputation
for the strive for excellence, with students consistently achieving commendable
results in both academic and co-curricular activities, the ability to respond
positively to challenges and to serve the community - thereby living up
to the school's motto "Berani Berkhidmat - Dare to Serve".</p>
<p>Looking back, we have come a long way since 1956 when we started with
only 116 students in three Secondary 2 classes and 227 students in six
Secondary 1 classes, 15 teachers, 5 clubs and 1 uniformed group in shared
premises. Throughout this journey, the motto and values of Quest have shone
bright and our students showed their respect, care, resilience, integrity
and the strive for excellence in school and onwards in their careers. These
are the lifelong values of Queenstownians.</p>
<p>Viva QUEST! Queenstownian for Life !</p>
