<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Welcome to Queenstown Secondary School. We are excited to share that from
2024, Secondary 1 Higher Chinese Language (HCL) will be offered.&nbsp;
If your child/ward did not take HCL in primary school, but did well in
Chinese Language (CL), i.e. scoring AL 1-2, he/she will be offered HCL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there are three more junctures for students to be offered
HCL, based on their results and recommendations by CL teachers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>At the end of Secondary 1 Semester 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 EOY&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 2 EOY</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We would also like to share that for Higher Malay Language (HML) and Higher
Tamil Language (HTL), at the end of Secondary 2, selected students will
be recommended by their teachers to do HML and HTL in language centres.</p>
