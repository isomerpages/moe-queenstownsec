<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your child has been posted to another secondary school during the 2024
Secondary 1 Posting Exercise and you wish to seek a transfer to Queenstown
Secondary School in 2025 instead, please apply using the link below:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://go.gov.sg/sec1qtsstransferappeal2025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sec1qtsstransferappeal2025</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that student transfers are subjected to the availability of
vacancies in the school. The outcome of the appeal will be released after
MOE's Mass Appeal Exercise is completed by end Dec 2024. &nbsp;Students
should still complete the registration exercise and report to the posted
secondary school on 2 January 2025 before the transfer is finalised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
