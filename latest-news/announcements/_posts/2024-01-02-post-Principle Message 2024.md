<p><strong><u>Principal’s Message 2024<br></u></strong>
</p>
<p>As I embark on my third year at Queenstown Secondary School (QTSS), I
continue to be inspired by the deep sense of love that permeates our school
community. In my interactions with staff, Queenstownians, alumni, parents,
and members of the School Advisory Committee, it is evident that QTSS holds
a special place in the hearts of many.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In QTSS, I am fortunate to work alongside a strong core of dedicated key
personnel as well as teaching and non-teaching staff, many of whom have
served as steadfast stalwarts. Indeed, connecting through the generations
of school staff is our school’s philosophy – we believe in the unique worth
of the individual, the enhancement of his well-being, and the symbiotic
relation between himself and society.</p>
<p><em><u>The unique worth of the individual</u></em>
</p>
<p>Over the past two years, I have had individual chats with every graduating
Queenstownian to hear their dreams and hopes for their future. These exchanges
have been both humbling and inspiring, as these Queenstownians passionately
shared about their diverse interests that drive them to make positive changes
for themselves and those around them. Their enthusiasm for life and self-belief
instill in me the confidence that they will undoubtedly achieve success
on their own terms and time. Through their stories, it is evident that
while each student might have faced unique challenges in their quest to
learn, they are grateful for the tireless encouragement and motivation
from their teachers to overcome these challenges. I am confident that this
growth mindset and resilience will propel Queenstownians toward success
in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><u>The symbiotic relation between the individual and society</u></em>
</p>
<p>In my message last year, I wrote about the rapid emergence of AI and its
impact on shaping the landscape of the future, underscoring therefore the
importance of orienting our Queenstownians for the future. Simultaneously,
the COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a profound disruptor, compelling various
sectors to challenge the status quo. The pace of change in the working
world is accelerating, necessitating our Queenstownians to cultivate new
mindsets and acquire new skillsets for sustained success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To that end of ensuring that our Queenstownians are well-prepared for
the fast-evolving world of learning and working, the school has significantly
expanded our Educational and Career Guidance programme, for one, by forging
partnerships with industry leaders such as IKEA, Singapore Hilton Hotels,
The Polyolefin Company, Seagate, Micron, the Maritime and Port Authority,
Elsie’s Kitchen, Tetra Pak, Swedish Chamber of Commerce, as well as esteemed
educational partners like Ngee Ann Polytechnic and the National University
of Singapore (Residential College 4). Working with and learning from these
partners will afford our Queenstownians a broader perspective of the world
and provide a keener awareness of the opportunities that they will gain
from focusing on learning well in school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, given the rapid pace of technological development, it is
now more imperative than ever that our school’s Total Curriculum remains
dedicated to fostering in our Queenstownians a growth mindset and competencies
that are distinctly human and challenging for machines to replicate or
attain. The acquisition of 21st Century Competencies, especially adaptive
thinking and inventive thinking, communication, and collaborative skills,
along with future literacies such as digital literacy and sustainability
literacy, is crucial to ensure that our Queenstownians are prepared, not
just for life in school, but also for the school of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><u>The enhancement of the individual’s well-being</u></em>
</p>
<p>Key to the effectiveness of our Total Curriculum is our thriving school
community. One example of this is a school-wide peer support and buddy
system through which Queenstownians care and look out for each other. This
was featured previously in the Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Schoolbag
newsletter. (hyperlink to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.schoolbag.edu.sg/story/helping-kids-feel-good-about-themselves</a>).
Strong teacher-student and student-student relationships are foundational
in creating a positive learning environment. In our school, form teachers
are known as Class Mentors (CMs), assuming the crucial role of significant
adults in our students’ lives. Our CMs invest time in building strong relationships
with Queenstownians to ensure their well-being and guide them to be anchored
in our school values. Queenstownians are also placed in the same mixed
form classes throughout their years in our school, allowing them to build
deep relationships with their CMs and classmates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, our school motto, “Berani Berkhidmat – Dare to Serve”, has left
an indelible mark on generations of Queenstownians, inspiring them to embody
this call to service and leadership. I am dedicated to nurturing and amplifying
our staff and Queenstownians’ ‘Dare to Serve’ spirit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to journeying through 2024 with our QTSS community!</p>
<p>Berani Berkhidmat,</p>
<p>Mr Sim How Chong
<br>Principal</p>
