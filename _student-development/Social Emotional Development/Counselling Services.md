Counselling Services
====================

**What is Counselling?**
========================

Counselling is a collaborative process in which the counsellor facilitates the expansion of the student’s view of life, enlarges his repertoire of coping resources and enables him to make choices for change in himself, the situation and the environment, without destructive consequences to self or others.

**<u>How does Counselling work?</u>**

Counselling is most effective when the student and School Counsellor work collaboratively together to address issues and concerns in a safe, confidential setting. The School Counsellor will listen carefully and try to understand the student’s concerns with a view to helping the student make sense of his/her difficulties. The counselling process is directed by the application of specialised skills and strategies in a therapeutic relationship with the student with problems. The goal of intervention is to help students manage these problems effectively so that their total development would not be impeded. Counselling may involve: Discovering new ways of coping, making changes, developing new skills and finding what works best for the individual.

The number of counselling sessions will be mutually agreed upon by the student and the School Counsellor. For counselling to be most effective, regular attendance is essential, therefore it is important that the student commits to attending appointments arranged.

**<u>What happens during a counselling session with our school counsellors?</u>**

Counselling sessions usually lasts 45-60 minutes where school counsellors and students explore concerns together. ALL sessions are CONFIDENTIAL and this means:

*   Details of the sessions will not be recorded in the student’s report book nor shared openly with other school personnel.
*   However, school counsellors are required to break confidentiality should the counsellor thinks that the student or someone else is at risk of being harmed.

\*The School Counsellor will explain the full limits of confidentiality during the first assessment appointment. It is normal practice for the School Counsellor to let the referrer know that the student has completed counselling. This will be done in discussion with the student and with his/her knowledge and agreement.

**<u>Who is counselling for?</u>**

Counselling is suitable for students who are experiencing (but not limited to) certain difficulties such as:

*   Stress
*   Academic/ School Anxieties
*   Grief and Loss
*   Relationship issues with Peers
*   Family Conflicts
*   Bullying

Students requiring more intense intervention will be referred to MOE Guidance Specialists or professional agencies, such as the Child Guidance Clinic.
