Special Educational Needs (SEN)
===============================

At Queenstown Secondary School, we strive to support all students to enable them to achieve and taste success in school. For some students with special educational needs, additional support may be needed to help them achieve their goals.

To provide the different types of support required by the students, our Special Education Needs Officer works closely with Teachers Trained in Special Needs (TSN) to provide learning and support and plan instructional strategies and adapt lessons for students with special educational needs.

Other specialised provisions include Access Arrangements for students during school-based and national examinations, providing barrier-free accessibility and resourcing for assistive technology devices etc.

Overseeing the support for students with SEN are:

Ms Kang Poh Geok, Year Head (Upper Secondary)

Ms Joyce Toh Zi Qian, Special Education Needs Officer

Please contact us directly to discuss your childâ€™s specific needs.
