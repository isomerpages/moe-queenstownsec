<h1>Sexuality Education</h1>
<p><strong>QUEENSTOWN SECONDARY SCHOOL</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about
enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional
changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships
including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the
importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging
healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended
family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for
the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities
in Singapore on sexuality issues.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;The goals of Sexuality Education are to:
<br><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;Support students in managing their physiological,
social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy
relationships.
<br><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp;Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible
decisions on secuality matters.
<br><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp;Help students develop a moral compass and
respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values
and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic
unit of society.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;The key messages of Sexuality Education are:
<br><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;Love and respect yourself as you love and respect
others;
<br><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp;Build positive relationships based on love
and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);
<br><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself, your
family and society; and
<br><strong>(iv)</strong>&nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best protection
against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt
you and your loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF QUEENSTOWN SECONDARY SCHOOL’S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2025</strong>
<br><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic
manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education
is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships,
Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may
click&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for
more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality
include:
<br><strong>a.</strong>&nbsp;Science
<br><strong>b.</strong>&nbsp;Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons:</strong>
<br><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;The values and attitudes of our youth towards
sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media,
popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life
as the adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles
with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally
from 15 – 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The
gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency
to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual
activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences
that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance
can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one’s ability to act responsibly.
Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves
and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth,
personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of
sexual behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Through the Sexuality Education lessons, secondary
students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop
their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills
to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern
at this age.</p>
<p><strong>At Queenstown Secondary School, the following lessons from the Sexuality Education Programme will be taught in&nbsp;2025:</strong>

<p><strong>eTeens&nbsp;Programme:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;eTeens&nbsp;is a programme developed by Health
Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, for Secondary
3 students to provide them with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection
from a health perspective.&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is conducted in two
segments – a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Students are taught skills such as decision-making,
assertiveness and negotiation to say “no” to sex and negative peer pressure.
They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and
involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key
messages. The desired outcome of the&nbsp;eTeens&nbsp;programme is that
students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.</p>
<p><strong>At Queenstown Secondary School, the&nbsp;<em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;programme will be implemented as follows in 2025:</strong>
