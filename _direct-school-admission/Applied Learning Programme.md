<h1>Applied Learning Programme</h1>
<p><strong>Direct School Admission 2025</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme – Environmental Sustainability</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Science for Sustainable Development</strong>
</p>
<p>The Quest to foster a culture of environmental responsibility in our students,
by striving to raise awareness of sustainable practices, inspiring them
to take meaningful action, and lead by example in conserving our planet's
resources. Through continuous learning, proactive advocacy, and collaborative
efforts, we aim to drive positive change and empower our students to become
stewards of a more sustainable future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our school’s ALP adopts a&nbsp;<u>thematic approach</u>, where students
explore global geographical issues related to sustainability, namely:</p>
<p>Sec 1: Water Sustainability</p>
<p>Sec 2: Urban and Energy Sustainability</p>
<p>These three themes, which are aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030,
are critical for Singapore’s continued development. We leverage current
and relevant learning content to design engaging packages that help our
students apply their knowledge of Geography and Science to solve a real-world
issue.</p>
