<p><strong>Queenstown Basketball (Boys &amp; Girls) &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>At QUEST Basketball, we don’t just train athletes — we shape resilient, values-driven individuals.</strong>
<br>
<br>Our programme is more than just about scoring baskets; it’s a journey
of growth, character, and excellence — both on and off the court.
<br>
<br>We believe in nurturing the <em>whole person</em>. Beyond drills and match
strategies, our players grow through structured strength and conditioning
sessions, leadership development, team-bonding camps, and competitive exposure.
Every training is underpinned by our core values — <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>respect</strong>, <strong>teamwork</strong>,
and <strong>responsibility</strong>.</p>
<p>Behind every player is a passionate coaching team and a supportive school
environment. Our teachers and coaches work hand in hand to ensure that
each student-athlete receives the academic and emotional support they need
to thrive. We see every player as a unique individual — and we are committed
to helping them reach their full potential.</p>
<p>While results may take time, we know that strong foundations lead to long-term
success. <strong>The journey of our girls’ basketball team — now in its second year — is a testament to perseverance and team spirit.</strong> Despite
the initial challenges, their positivity, resilience, and commitment to
growth continue to inspire the rest of the school. We remain hopeful and
confident that in the coming years, their hard work will bear fruit.</p>
