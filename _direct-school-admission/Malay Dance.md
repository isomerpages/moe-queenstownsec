Malay Dance
===========

**Direct School Admission 2023 (MALAY DANCE)**

**Our Story**

For our Questari dancers, dance has always been their passion, and the co-curricular activity offers our dancers the opportunity to embark on an enriching and fantastic journey, exploring the wide array of traditional Malay dance genres. These dance genres include Joget, Zapin, Asli, Inang and Masri. Each dance form depicts the many aspects of the Malay culture and traditions.  
  
Our dedicated coach choreographs delicate, enchanting and energetic dance movements to create a traditional dance form that allows our dancers to move gracefully on stage. Our dances also incorporate the creative use of the&nbsp;_kompang_&nbsp;(hand-held drum),&nbsp;_tepak sireh_&nbsp;(ornate betel leaf container), umbrella,&nbsp;_sarong_&nbsp;and other Malay ceremonial mainstays as dance props, adding to the beauty and enchantment of our dance form.

Our dancers demonstrate resilience and excellence through their dedication to perfect their dance movements. Our dancers have built a strong sense of belonging, teamwork and respect for each other. They always perform to their upmost best and as part of our character development, we serve the community and perform at communal events, enacting our school motto,&nbsp;_Berani Berkhidmat_&nbsp;(Dare to Serve).

It is no surprise that our dance group has been outstanding in performance. We have obtained&nbsp;**Certificates of Distinction**&nbsp;at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation for three consecutive years – in 2017, 2019, and 2021. Our Questari dancers are also regularly invited to perform at external events. These platforms further hone their skills and confidence as they showcase their graceful dance movements to members of the public.

Beyond SYF, our dancers participated in a variety of events to hone and showcase their talents. These included performing at CNY concerts, QTSS Speech Day, Community Hari Raya Festive Celebrations, Muara Festival 2022 @ Esplanade Outdoor Theatre, Mutiara Tari 2022 Competition @Wisma Geylang Serai, among others.&nbsp;


We welcome students who are passionate and have the experience and flair in any dance form to join through the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise
