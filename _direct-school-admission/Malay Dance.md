<h1>Malay Dance</h1>
<p><strong>Direct School Admission 2025 (MALAY DANCE)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong>
</p>
<p>For our Questari dancers, dance has always been their passion, and the
co-curricular activity offers our dancers the opportunity to embark on
an enriching and fantastic journey, exploring the wide array of traditional
Malay dance genres. These dance genres include Joget, Zapin, Asli, Inang
and Masri. Each dance form depicts the many aspects of the Malay culture
and traditions.
<br>
<br>Our dedicated coach choreographs delicate, enchanting and energetic dance
movements to create a traditional dance form that allows our dancers to
move gracefully on stage. Our dances also incorporate the creative use
of the <em>kompang</em> (hand-held drum), <em>tepak sireh</em> (ornate betel
leaf container), <em>terendak</em> (decorative conical hat), umbrella, <em>sarong</em> and
other Malay ceremonial mainstays as dance props, adding to the beauty and
enchantment of our dance form.</p>
<p>Our dancers demonstrate resilience and excellence through their dedication
to perfect their dance movements. Our dancers have built a strong sense
of belonging, teamwork and respect for each other. They always perform
to their best ability and as part of our character development, we serve
the community and perform at communal events, enacting our school motto, <em>Berani Berkhidmat</em> (Dare
to Serve).
<br>

<p><strong><u>Key Achievements</u></strong>

<p>Our dance group has shown outstanding performances during SYF. We obtained

(SYF) Arts Presentation for three consecutive years - in 2017, 2019, and
2021. For SYF 2023, we obtained the <strong>Certificate of Accomplishment</strong>.
For SYF 2025, we are delighted to share that we obtained the <strong>Certificate of Distinction.</strong> Our
Questari dancers remain resilient and dedicated to improving their performances.
Questari dancers have performed extensively for school and external events
to illustrate their commitment and passion in the vibrant arts arena.
