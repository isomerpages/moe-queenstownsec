<p><strong>Direct School Admission 2024 (Volleyball)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>QUEST Volleyball</strong>
</p>
<p>Our QUEST Volleyball family aims to develop responsible and self-disciplined
athletes through a rigorous training programme that focuses on imparting
values and skills. The highlights of the training programme include Queen’s
Cup (an annual friendly competition with Queensway Secondary School), National
School Games (NSG), Overseas immersion trip and our Volleyball bonding
camp.</p>
<p>QUEST Volleyball has consistently achieved the top 4 placing in the South
Zone for the annual National School Games. In 2021, despite the COVID-19
disruption, our B-Division Girls emerged as South-Zone Champions. In 2022,
our B-Division Boys and C-Division Girls both clinched the South-Zone 2nd
Runners-Up positions. In 2023, our B-Division Girls came in 3rd in the
Zonal competition and played extremely well to reach the Nationals Quarterfinals.
Our C-division girls team won South Zone champion and our C-division Boy
teams came in 3rd place. This year, our B-division Boys won 3rd placing
in South Zone and out B-division Girls came in 4th place.</p>
<p>In addition, QUEST volleyball will be going overseas to Taiwan at the
end of the year. Our players will be immersing in the Taiwanese culture
by attending lessons with their student buddies and will also be training
with the volleyball team in Taiwan. This is an invaluable opportunity for
our players to build their cultural and social capital by forging friendships
with youths from other cultures. The overseas trip will also strengthen
the camaraderie within the team.</p>
<p>We welcome students who are passionate and committed in volleyball to
participate in the Direct School Admission (DSA) Exercise. Parents and
students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s
aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic
requirements, and the programme available to develop the area of talent.</p>
