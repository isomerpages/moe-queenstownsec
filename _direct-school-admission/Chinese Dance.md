<p><strong>Direct School Admission 2025 (CHINESE DANCE)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong>
</p>
<p>For our Quest Chinese dancers, dance has always been their passion, and
this co-curricular activity offers our dancers the opportunity to embark
on an enriching and fantastic journey, exploring the wide array of different
Chinese dance genres. This includes exploring both contemporary Chinese
dance and traditional Chinese dance steps. Each dance form depicts the
many aspects our Chinese culture and traditions.</p>
<p>
<br>Our dedicated coach choreographs delicate, enchanting and energetic dance
movements to create a traditional dance form that allows our dancers to
move gracefully on stage. Our dances also incorporate the creative use
of various props, like the silk fan, long bouts of cloth, the sleeves (水袖)
and other Chinese mainstays as dance props, adding to the beauty and enchantment
of our dance form.</p>
<p>Our dancers demonstrate resilience and excellence through their dedication
to perfect their dance movements. Our dancers have built a strong sense
of belonging, teamwork and respect for each other. They always performed
to their best ability and as part of our character development, we serve
the community and perform at communal events, enacting our school motto, <em>Berani Berkhidmat</em> (Dare
to Serve).
