<p>Our School Advisory Committee (SAC) plays a pivotal role in partnering
our school to drive and strengthen our vision, mission, values and strategic
direction. Leveraging their rich expertise, diverse perspectives, extensive
experiences and networks, they offer critical insights and advice on shaping
the school’s strategic focus in alignment with MOE’s policy framework.
Our SAC members also provide generous resources and opportunities to enrich
our students’ learning experiences, guiding students to live out the school’s
motto ‘Berani Berkhidmat – Dare to Serve’.</p>
<p>Our SAC comprises members from the business, social and community sectors,
as well as our distinguished alumni.</p>
<p>The current 2023 – 2024 SAC has established the SAC scholarship for academically
deserving Secondary 1 students who chose to enroll in Queenstown Secondary
School. They were instrumental in the reimagining and transforming of the
school’s learning spaces, including the redesign and renovation of the
school’s Learning Commons (previously known as the library).</p>
<p>The outgoing 2023 – 2024 SAC members are:</p>
