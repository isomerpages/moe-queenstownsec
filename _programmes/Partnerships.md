<p><strong>Introduction of Partnership Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Educational career guidance through partnerships is a core experience
that students go through, aimed at providing our students with exposure
to potential career paths and real-world experience. Over the years, we
have partnered with companies from different industries on learning journeys
and work attachment programmes. Through these opportunities, students have
a clearer understanding of how what their knowledge and skills are applied
in the job setting and make informed career choices which are aligned with
their strengths and interests.</p>

<p><strong>Key Learning Experiences: Examples of Learning Journeys and Work Attachment</strong>
</p>
<p><u>1. Quest for an Environmentally Sustainable world - Work Attachment and Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>The Polyolefin Company</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Polyolefin Company, which focuses on manufacturing and sales of Low
Density Polyethlyene (LDPE) and Polypropylene (PP)<sup>1</sup>, offers
Queenstownians a glimpse into the petrochemical world where the chemistry
knowledge they acquired in the classroom magically comes to live.</p>
<p>Leveraging on our partnership with TPC, Queenstownians have, for over
11 years, been blessed with the opportunity of travelling into a land where
few are able to step foot on – Jurong Island, which is the main reason
why Singapore is the top oil exporting country in the world despite not
having any oil reserves of our own.</p>
<p>Following a 3-hour learning journey where they are able to gather a broad
overview of the innovations and operations at TPC, a few Queenstownians,
passionate about making a difference with their science mastery, furthered
their experience and learning by going through a full-day work attachment.
During the work attachment, they interacted with the engineers at TPC,
gaining invaluable insights into the rigour and satisfaction derived from
the role of creating products used widely.</p>

<p><u>2. Quest for an Informed world – Learning Journey to</u><strong><u> Star International</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With 7 distinct brands and presence in more than 30 countries worldwide,
the learning journey to Star International has allowed our students to
gather firsthand information about the workings behind a successful retail
and logistics industry, which has provided furniture for many homes in
Singapore.</p>
<p>Queenstownians who participated in this learning journey were also able
to understand how companies are innovating to overcome the challenges they
face, in this instance, the use of technology to overcome manpower shortage.</p>

<p><u>3. Quest for a Healthy world – Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>Elsie’s Kitchen</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As one of the more renowned catering companies in the culinary landscape
in Singapore as well as the region, this collaboration with Elsie’s Kitchen
offered Queenstownians a behind the scenes glimpse of what goes on before
and after an order is placed.</p>
<p>They also gained valuable insights into the application of the knowledge
of food sciences in an authentic setting when the company shared about
the considerations behind its menu evolution, balancing taste with nutrition,
in response to changes in consumer demands.</p>

<p><u>4. Quest for a Safe World – Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>Rockwell Automation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Being the largest company in the world dedicated to industrial automation
and digital transformation, the learning journey to Rockwell Automation
Singapore has allowed our Queenstownians to gather firsthand information
about the workings behind a successful innovation and automation industry.</p>
<p>During the learning journey, Queenstownians understood the importance
of being adaptable as they gained an awareness of how the company needs
to constantly innovate to effectively address the demands of the ever-changing
landscape in the industry. Subsequently, the participants were able to
experience the production process through the use of augmented reality
before wrapping up the learning journey with a Q&amp;A session with a panel
of professionals from Rockwell Automation.</p>

<p><u>5. Quest for an Inclusive and Environmentally Sustainable World – Work Attachment and Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>IKEA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Partnering with IKEA, a world-renowned furniture brand that champions
for both social and economic sustainability through providing affordable
and practical furniture that are innovatively designed to reduce material
usage and wastage, has allowed Queenstownians to see the theories they
learnt in the classroom being applied in an authentic setting.</p>
<p>Appealing to Queenstownians with a keen interest in design and innovation,
this learning journey opened the eyes of selected Sec 3 Design &amp; Technology
students as they had the precious opportunity to interact with the IKEA
designers and learnt about a product’s life journey, from design to testing
and manufacturing, and eventually retail. These valuable experiences enabled
our students to appreciate how the design thinking process that they have
learnt in the classroom is practiced in the actual design and manufacturing
industry; resulting in IKEA addressing the diverse needs of their consumers,
ranging from age to affordability and lifestyle preferences.</p>
