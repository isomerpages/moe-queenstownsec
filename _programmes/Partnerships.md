<p><strong>Introduction of Partnership Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Educational career guidance through partnerships is a core experience
that students go through, aimed at providing our students with exposure
to potential career paths and real-world experience. Over the years, we
have partnered with companies from different industries on learning journeys
and work attachment programmes. Through these opportunities, students have
a clearer understanding of how what their knowledge and skills are applied
in the job setting and make informed career choices which are aligned with
their strengths and interests.</p>

<p><strong>Key Learning Experiences: Examples of Learning Journeys and Work Attachment</strong>
</p>
<p><u>1. Quest for an Environmentally Sustainable world - Work Attachment and Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>The Polyolefin Company</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Polyolefin Company, which focuses on manufacturing and sales of Low
Density Polyethlyene (LDPE) and Polypropylene (PP)<sup>1</sup>, offers
Queenstownians a glimpse into the petrochemical world where the chemistry
knowledge they acquired in the classroom magically comes to live.</p>
<p>Leveraging on our partnership with TPC, Queenstownians have, for over
11 years, been blessed with the opportunity of travelling into a land where
few are able to step foot on â€“ Jurong Island, which is the main reason
why Singapore is the top oil exporting country in the world despite not
having any oil reserves of our own.</p>
<p>Following a 3-hour learning journey where they are able to gather a broad
overview of the innovations and operations at TPC, a few Queenstownians,
passionate about making a difference with their science mastery, furthered
their experience and learning by going through a full-day work attachment.
During the work attachment, they interacted with the engineers at TPC,
gaining invaluable insights into the rigour and satisfaction derived from
the role of creating products used widely.</p>
