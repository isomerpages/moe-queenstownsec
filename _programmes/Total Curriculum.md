<p>The Total Curriculum Framework drives QTSS Curriculum, both inside and
outside of the classroom, driven by our belief that every Queenstownian
is unique, has the potential to grow, and want to serve. The school adopts
a school-wide teaching approach – authentic content, student-centric pedagogy
and balanced assessment, enabled by the use of technology; to design learning
experiences where every Queenstownian plays an active role in acquiring
the school values (R2ICE), 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies and Sustainability
Literacy through a Learn, Do, and Reflect cycle. Every Queenstownian will
therefore be able to connect, collaborate and create, flourishing as a
learner and leading with a future-oriented mindset within a thriving community.</p>
