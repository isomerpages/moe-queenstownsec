<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) days as part of Blended Learning, have been
implemented in secondary schools since the end of 2022 to provide students
with more opportunities to learn independently and to be more self-directed
in their learning. The HBL days are designed to complement in-school learning.</p>
<p>Regular HBL days are scheduled about twice a month for secondary school
and pre-university students represents about 10% of curriculum time in
an academic year. This is a good balance that allows students to experience
HBL often enough to develop the skills and mindsets to become more independent
and self-directed learners, without unduly compromising the in-person learning
experience in schools.</p>

Learning (SIL), please click <a href="/files/02_QTSS_HBL_SIL_Briefing_to_parents_Sem1_2025_updated.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Here</a>
