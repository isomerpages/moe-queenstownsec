Learning for Life Programme
===========================

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Queenstown Secondary School leverages on 2 things to nurture all Queenstownians as Community Youth Leaders:

1.  our rich heritage and belief in serving the community, and
2.  our strength in nurturing leadership qualities.

We seek to grow specifically in our students the competencies in emotional quotient (EQ), cultural quotient (CQ) and adversity quotient (AQ). We leverage on the Kolb’s (1975) Model of Learning to strengthen our students’ experiential learning in the various NYAA platforms, with carefully chosen experiences for reflection and critical analysis, synthesis and decision-making.

We believe that journaling and reflecting, analysis and synthesising are critical ingredients, apart from concrete experiences, to ensure sound decision-making processes occur in the minds of our students. Hence, we adapted our **Traffic Light Model** from the Funnel Model (Priest et al, 2000) to equip our students with the lifelong skills of reflection.

Through the various NYAA components of Outdoor Appreciation, Healthy Living, and Service, all Queenstownians are nurtured to **R2ISE** (School Values) as future-ready leaders, actively contributing to society (School Vision). These platforms allow our students to grow their leadership capacities from personal mastery to peer mastery to community leadership.

A basic CYL Curriculum is also implemented to all our students to equip them with the 7 habits of highly effective teens, The Leadership Challenge Practices, and Design Thinking, among other skillsets, to carry out meaningful projects to benefit the community. Identified students are further exposed to the opportunity to lead their peers in planning for meaningful projects for a cause and even extend their sphere of influence to benefit other countries in our region.

Through our LLP – Community and Youth Leadership, our students are prepared for life’s challenges. Their good habits and essential life skills make them self-sufficient and effective. The school values and quotients make them good persons who care enough to transcend beyond their own needs, good citizens who have the courage and dare to serve and change the world for the better.
