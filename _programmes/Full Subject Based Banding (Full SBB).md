Queenstown Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards.&nbsp; Here are some of the media articles featuring Queenstown Secondary School.

**Full SBB Pilot in Queenstown Secondary School in 2020**

As part of the pilot, our school will implement reorganised form classes at Secondary 1.

**This is applicable to Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2020.**

Our reorganised form classes will enable students of varying academic abilities and backgrounds to come together to contribute valuable differences in perspective and create broader opportunities for learning amongst peers.

Students will attend lessons for academic subjects in subject classes groups according to their academic abilities (Express/Normal Academic/Normal Technical Level)

Our school’s participation as a Full SBB pilot school will leverage existing strengths. Queenstown has been a SBB prototype school&nbsp;since 2014, and we have put in place sound and effective processes to help us cater to different learner needs in the classroom. As part of our total curriculum framework, we also offer strong socio-emotional support structures as well as service and leadership programmes to ensure the holistic development and well-being of each student.

Currently, many of our SBB students continue on to take out-of-stream subjects at the upper secondary level. With the strong foundation established by taking SBB subjects, many do well in their national examinations and progress to the post-secondary education pathway of their choice. They even go on to win awards such as the Lee Kuan Yew Award for Outstanding Normal Course students.

At Queenstown, we remain committed to providing a conducive environment for all students to thrive. We are confident that the Full SBB Pilot will build on our existing strengths and will enable us to develop Queenstownians who embody our school’s vision of ‘Leaders for Tomorrow, Anchored in Values, Committed to Serve.’

For more information on how our school would implement Full SBB, you can contact us at&nbsp;[qtss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:qtss@moe.edu.sg). The school will also be engaging parents of cohorts of students who are involved in the pilot in 2019/2020.
