<p><strong>Introduction of Partnership Programmes to support Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong>
</p>
<p>Education and career guidance through partnerships is a core experience
that students go through, aimed at providing our students with exposure
to potential career paths and real-world experience. Over the years, we
have partnered with companies from different industries on learning journeys
and work attachment programmes. Through these opportunities, students have
a clearer understanding of how their knowledge and skills are applied in
the job setting and make informed career choices which are aligned with
their strengths and interests.
<br>
<br>At the same time, we believe in the importance of community partnerships
to foster stronger connections and personal growth. These initiatives are
designed for students to work with diverse groups of people and examine
real-world challenges. Through these experiences, students develop a deeper
understanding of social issues and cultivate a sense of empathy and responsibility,
empowering them to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>

<p><strong>Key Learning Experiences: Examples of Learning Journeys and Work Attachment</strong>
</p>
<p><u>1. Quest for an Environmentally Sustainable World - Work Attachment and Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>The Polyolefin Company</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Polyolefin Company, which focuses on manufacturing and sales of Low
Density Polyethlyene (LDPE) and Polypropylene (PP)<sup>1</sup>, offers
Queenstownians a glimpse into the petrochemical world where the chemistry
knowledge they acquired in the classroom magically comes to live.</p>
<p>Leveraging on our partnership with TPC, Queenstownians have, for over
12 years, been blessed with the opportunity of travelling into a land where
few are able to step foot on – Jurong Island, which is the main reason
why Singapore is the top oil exporting country in the world despite not
having any oil reserves of our own.</p>
<p>Following a 3-hour learning journey where they are able to gather a broad
overview of the innovations and operations at TPC, a few Queenstownians,
passionate about making a difference with their science mastery, furthered
their experience and learning by going through a full-day work attachment.
During the work attachment, they interacted with the engineers at TPC,
gaining invaluable insights into the rigour and satisfaction derived from
the role of creating products used widely.</p>

<p><u>2. Quest for an Informed World – Learning Journey to</u><strong><u> Aeroviation Pte Ltd</u></strong>
</p>
<p>With keen interest to bring people and culture across the world together
through aviation, an afternoon to Aeroviation was what it took to give
13 aspiring Queenstownians their first taste of the dynamic world of aviation.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Captain Jaffar Hassan, a Queenstown alumni with
36 years of experience in the aviation industry, they gained valuable insights
about the different roles behind the scene that allows for travellers to
depart from and land safely at their desired destinations. From the commanding
presence of pilots to the strategic minds in Air Traffic Control, from
meticulous Flight Planning to precise Ground Control operations, the participants
were immersed in the fascinating ecosystem that powers modern aviation.</p>
<p>As the learning journey ended, one message resonated clearly: in aviation,
what matters it not the flying, but the connection and bonds that are built
because of it.</p>

<br>3. <u>Quest for a Safe and Sustainable World – Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>voco Orchard Singapore by IHG</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Being the one of the largest hotel groups in the world, IHG operates in
more than 100 countries across 19 brands such as Intercontinental, Holiday
Inn, and voco being a few of them. Their dedication to providing unforgettable
experiences to their guests while incorporating sustainable development
places them in a good position to allow our Queenstownians to gather firsthand
information about the thought processes and beliefs necessary to remain
at the forefront of the highly competitive hospitality industry.</p>
<p>During the learning journey, Queenstownians understood the importance
of understanding the needs of the different guest profiles as they were
brought through how IHG address these diverse needs via the different brands
under them. They were then treated to a tour around the hotel, both front
of house and back of the house to better appreciate the different departments
that come together to create a welcoming and safe experience for the hotel
guests. Candid questioning with the hotel staff and interns of the hotel
wrapped up this learning journey as Queenstownians better appreciate the
challenges and motivations behind the smiles and friendly dispositions
that greet every hotel guest that arrives.

<p><u>4. Quest for a Healthy world – Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>Equip Medical Pte Ltd</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As one of South-East Asia’s most prominent medical and baby care distribution
companies, the learning journey to Equip Medical Pte Ltd allowed Queenstownians
to gather firsthand information about the workings behind the distribution
of medical products and equipment. During the learning journey, they even
had the opportunity of interacting with Mr Jimmy Tay, Group CEO of Equip
Medical Group of Companies, who is also an alumni of Queenstown Secondary
School, hearing for themselves how the company navigated through the challenges
and respond effectively to the rapidly changing demands in the technological
landscape to remain relevant to the needs of a healthy world.</p>

<br><u>5. Quest for an Inclusive and Environmentally Sustainable World – Work Attachment and Learning Journey to </u><strong><u>IKEA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Partnering with IKEA, a world-renowned furniture brand that champions
for both social and economic sustainability through providing affordable
and practical furniture that are innovatively designed to reduce material
usage and wastage, has allowed Queenstownians to see the theories they
learnt in the classroom being applied in an authentic setting.</p>
<p>Appealing to Queenstownians with a keen interest in design and innovation,
this learning journey opened the eyes of selected Sec 3 Design &amp; Technology
students as they had the precious opportunity to interact with the IKEA
designers and learnt about a product’s life journey, from design to testing
and manufacturing, and eventually retail. These valuable experiences enabled
our students to appreciate how the design thinking process that they have
learnt in the classroom is practiced in the actual design and manufacturing
industry; resulting in IKEA addressing the diverse needs of their consumers,
ranging from age to affordability and lifestyle preferences.</p>

<br><strong>Key Learning Experiences: Career Mentoring</strong>
<br>
<br>On 16 November 2024, we kicked off our first Career Mentoring @ QUEST
session at the newly-renovated library. It was inspiring to see senior
alumni spanning from the 1970s to 2000s return to share their stories and
career advice with the junior alumni.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The panel and group mentoring sessions sparked meaningful discussions
about navigating the evolving career landscape and cultivating timeless
competencies. But the session wasn’t just about learning — it was also
about building connections and bridging generations to strengthen our QUEST
community.</p>

<br><strong>Key Learning Experiences: Examples of Community Projects</strong>
<br>
<br><u>1. Quest for an Inclusive World – </u><strong><u>MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens Schools</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Heading into the 12<sup>th</sup> year of our partnership, Queenstown Secondary
School is glad to have journeyed alongside MINDS Lee Kong Chian Gardens
Schools as we continue to promote inclusivity, raise general awareness
of special educational needs, as well as the appreciation of the strengths
and abilities of people with high special educational needs.</p>
<p>Building on our longest running collaboration – Recess Buddy Programme
&nbsp;– Queenstownians better understand people with high special educational
needs while contributing to their growth towards independence. Queenstownians
also train and play with students from MINDS LGS as they team up to take
part in sports competitions, therein strengthening not only the self-confidence
of our friends from MINDS LGS, but also their friendship.</p>
<p>Students from MINDS LGS also give back to the community as they take part
in our annual communal lunch, where they perform for and serve the senior
citizens alongside our Queenstownians.</p>
<p>As our partnership matures, Queenstownians continue to grow in their empathy
and realisation of people with high special educational needs, appreciating
that they also have their strengths and ways to contribute to the community.
Together, Queenstownians and students from MINDS LGS strive to play our
part in moulding a more socially sustainable world.</p>

<br>
<br><u>2. Quest for an Inclusive World – </u><strong><u>NUS Residential College 4 (NUS RC4)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Queenstownians believe that there is a unique strength in everyone, regardless
of who they are. We are glad to collaborate with NUS RC4 on a journey that
aims to promote inter-generational bonding as well as active ageing. Through
this collaboration, selected Queenstownians interact with youths from NUS
RC4, as well as senior citizens, to explore the reasons behind seemingly
weak intergenerational bonds over multiple sessions of discussions and
activities.</p>
<p>As the participants came together and created programmes and activities
that would promote inclusiveness and active ageing among Senior citizens
within the larger community, everyone learnt something new from this experience,
with senior citizens believing that they still have much to give, and the
youths gaining deeper empathy and appreciation of the seniors in our community.
All these were accomplished amidst lots of fun and laughter.</p>
