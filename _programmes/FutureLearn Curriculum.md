<p><strong>Introduction of FutureLearn Curriculum (FutureLearn)</strong>
</p>
<p>FutureLearn Curriculum (FutureLearn) is our signature programme aimed
at equipping students with 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies (21<sup>st</sup> CC)
and future literacies – sustainability and digital literacy. To provide
a more cohesive learning experience, we have synergised our Applied Learning
and Learning for Life Programmes and aligned our Maker Education: Design
Challenges under the broad theme of “Sustainability”.</p>

<p><strong>FutureLearn Structure</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FutureLearn consists of three core pillars: Environmental Sustainability,
Community Youth Leadership (Social Sustainability) and Digital Literacy.
The curriculum is enriched and supported by Maker Education. In Secondary
3, students participate in a Capstone project which requires them to work
in teams to solve real-world challenges in their community. They have the
autonomy to choose project topics based on their passions and interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Leveraging the world as their classroom, selected students will also have
the opportunity to join overseas immersion trips. The QUEST Global programme
provides the overseas experience, helping students to better understand
the region and build valuable networks.</p>
