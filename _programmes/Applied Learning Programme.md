Applied Learning Programme
==========================

**Geography and Science**
-------------------------

Queenstown Secondary is one of the few schools in Singapore, which has in place the interdisciplinary (Geography and Science) Applied Learning Programme (ALP), first mentioned by the Minister of Education during the workplan seminar in 2013. The ALP alongside other programmes like Learning for Life Programme, are part of the blueprint of a good secondary school.  
Leveraging on Howard Gardner’s theory on 5 Minds for the Future, the aims of the Quest ALP are:

Students will be able to

1.  acquire inquiry skills via the&nbsp;**QUEST Approach**&nbsp;(**Disciplined Mind);**
2.  connect knowledge and skills learnt in Geography and Science as a continuum (**Synthesising Mind**);
3.  apply and extend these knowledge and understanding to explain and possess the wisdom to&nbsp;**solve real-world problems**&nbsp;(**Creating, Respectful and Ethical Mind**).

Equipped with the 5 Minds through the ALP programme, our students will be more ready to face the future, which is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous.

At the end of the programme, students will become responsible and active citizens who are well informed and concerned of environmental issues impacting Singapore and our neighbours.

As an extension to our environment sustainability education, our school also provides opportunities to promote active student participation in building an environmentally conscious community.

Below shows the list of programme and activities conducted for our ALP and environment sustainability education.

The objective of the programme is to encourage waste reduction and allowing students to take ownership on tackling the issue of plastic waste.</td></tr><tr><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#222;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">Secondary 2</td><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#222;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">How can we avoid an energy crisis?</td><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#222;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal"><span style="font-weight:400">Recap of the  QUEST Approach (Question, Uncover, Explain) in both Geography and Science lessons to solve a real-life issue (i.e. energy crisis in Singapore)</span><br><span style="font-weight:400">Students uncover on people’s attitudes towards energy consumption at home and carried out a scientific experiment on the power generation of solar panels</span><span style="font-weight:bold">.</span><br><span style="font-weight:400">Through geographical investigation to find out the suitability of sites and physics experiments to find out the factors affecting the efficiency of solar panels, students represent the data collected on visual forms such as graphs, and subsequently make conclusions.</span><br><span style="font-weight:400">Interdisciplinary Project Work on the design of a solar powered mobile charging device using design thinking and findings from Uncover and Explain Stages</span><br><span style="font-weight:400">Experiential Learning to Singapore Green Malls</span><br><span style="font-weight:400">Enrichment Programme at Pulau Ubin Powering Lives Trail and Solar Energy Car Challenge at Nanyang Polytechnic</span></td><td style="background-color:#FFF;border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;color:#222;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;text-align:left;vertical-align:top;word-break:normal">In conjunction with Youth for Environment Day 2020, a school-wide campaign, Quest4Less: Reducing Plastic, Fashion and Food Waste, was started.

**Moving Forward**
------------------

In 2021, the students can look forward to more authentic and engaging learning experiences.

The ALP team is working on the following areas:

*   offering more diverse range of options for our students through collaboration with other departments ;
*   leverage on the use of ICT tools to create a more purposeful and engaging learning experience for the students.
*   expanding the scope of our students’ experience in environmental sustainability through more future-oriented solutions such as the floating reservoir concept, smart technology in an urban environment and leveraging on technology for food sustainability.
