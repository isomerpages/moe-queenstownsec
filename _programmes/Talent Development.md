<p><strong>The Quest to…<br><br></strong>Bring out the unique strengths and
talents of every Queenstownian.</p>
<p><em>Uncovering Interests. Fostering Strengths. Demonstrating Talent. Impacting Community.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Key Approaches</strong>
</p>
<p>Our school’s Talent Development programme is dedicated to identifying
and developing the interests and passions of individual students, exploring
and deepening their potential strengths, and encouraging them to demonstrate
their talents in the Cognitive, Aesthetics, Physical, Social &amp; Moral
domains while contributing to the community.</p>
<p>Drawing on Treffinger’s Levels of Service model and the Social Change
Model of Leadership Development, we implement a structured three-tier approach
to develop our Queenstownians’ talents.</p>
