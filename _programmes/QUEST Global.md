<p><strong>Internationalisation Programme (QUEST Global)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Quest to provide authentic experiences that help students understand
how communities learn, collaborate, and thrive across different contexts.
Through overseas trips and hosting partner schools, Queenstownians engage
in collaboration, cultural exchanges and hands-on learning that build adaptability,
civic literacy and a deeper appreciation of Singapore’s place in a connected
world.</p>
<p>In 2024, we embarked on two QUEST Global trips: In Vietnam, Queenstownians
took part in cultural exchanges and volunteered at an orphanage that supports
adults and children affected by the legacy of Agent Orange. In Thailand,
another group of Queenstownians explored the country’s rich traditions
and bonded with local peers through friendly volleyball matches. These
interactions offered powerful lessons in empathy, diversity and global
citizenship.</p>

<p>In 2025, the programme expanded with another two QUEST Global trips: Applied
Learning Programme learning experiences in Japan, and a cultural exchange
and Service Learning journey to Indonesia. Looking ahead to 2026, students
will have further opportunities to deepen their global understanding through
an upcoming learning journey to China. Each experience strengthens their
confidence and curiosity while grounding them in a clear sense of identity
and responsibility as future contributors to Singapore’s continued success.</p>
