<p><strong>Internationalisation Programme (QUEST Global)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Quest to provide authentic experiences that help Queenstownians understand
how communities learn, collaborate, and thrive across different contexts.
Through overseas trips and hosting partner schools, Queenstownians engage
in collaboration, cultural exchanges and hands-on learning that build adaptability,
civic literacy and a deeper appreciation of Singapore’s place in a connected
world. These experiences are designed to help Queenstownians appreciate
the global opportunities and gain confidence to work with people globally,
both now and in the future. Through the meaningful integration of QUEST
Global assessment tasks, Queenstownians develop a deeper understanding
of their personal cultural identity and Singapore's identity, while learning
elements of another language to better connect with others. Through this
programme, students are equipped as future-oriented leaders who embody
our school motto – Dare to Serve.</p>
<p>In 2024, we embarked on two QUEST Global trips: In Vietnam, Queenstownians
took part in cultural exchanges and volunteered at an orphanage that supports
adults and children affected by Agent Orange. In Thailand, another group
of Queenstownians explored the country’s rich traditions and bonded with
local peers through friendly games. These interactions offered powerful
lessons in empathy, diversity and global citizenship.</p>

<p>In 2025, the programme expanded with another two QUEST Global trips: Sustainability-based
learning experiences in Japan for ALP and CYL student leaders, and a cultural
exchange and Service Learning journey to Indonesia.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2026, Queenstownians will have further opportunities
to deepen their global understanding through an upcoming learning journeys
to China and Vietnam. Each experience strengthens their confidence and
curiosity while grounding them in a clear sense of identity and responsibility
as future contributors to Singapore’s continued success.</p>
