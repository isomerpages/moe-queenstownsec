Concert Band
============



**Highlights of the Year**
----------
This year was packed with exciting events for
Questband. With a close-knit group of dedicated
members and supportive instructors, we
made every moment a memorable success.
The joy of playing together as a band brought
us closer, allowing us to create beautiful
music and lasting friendships. Despite facing
multiple challenges, we stood our ground,
adapting and supporting one another to the
very end. Following our motto, “With Passion,
We can succeed”, Questband will continue
to persevere and collaborate together to
achieve our goals and spread the joy of music
around.


**Key Achievements**

From school performances on
National Day and Chinese New Year to hosting
our very first Quest Arts Festival, each event
showcased our passion and teamwork as a
band.
