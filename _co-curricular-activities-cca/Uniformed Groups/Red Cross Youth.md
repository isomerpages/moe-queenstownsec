QTSS RCY had more key events in 2023. These events provided us with a platform to gain meaningful and memorable experience and helped us mature and gain confidence.  
 
In RCY, we learned many qualities, such as discipline and leadership. We also learned many important life skills, such as First Aid, including CPR, and many more, such as collaboration and communication skills. We learnt mainly to administer healthcare and save lives, as well as help the sick and the suffering. First aid aside, we also learned to care for our environment. In one of the key events, we went around Dawson to pick up litter. It was an eye-opening experience as we never realised just how much rubbish surrounded our school. Through this experience, we learned about the importance of taking care of our environment. 
 
In QTSS Red Cross Youth, we hope to instil not only care for each other, but also care for the environment around us.
