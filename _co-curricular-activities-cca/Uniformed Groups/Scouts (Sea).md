Scouts (Sea)
============

## **The Quest to...**

**The Quest to Spread the 03 Spirit**

The 03 spirit stands for loyalty, excellence in scouting, and personal growth. We strive to spread this spirit through friendship, positivity, and staying true to our troop and the scouting movement. Every 03 scout is an ambassador of this spirit—embracing teamwork, leadership, discipline, and respect for each other’s unique identities.

Our flag, raised at every meeting, proudly symbolizes our independence and heritage. “03” reflects our position as the third scout troop in Singapore, “1903” marks our district code, and the cog represents Queenstown Secondary’s past as a Technical School. The World Scout emblem reminds us of our shared global journey and where we come from.

## **Key Achievements**

This year was packed with adventure, teamwork, and milestones for our 03 Queenstown Scouts. Our Sec 1 recruits kicked off their journey with the Sec 1 Experience—campfire stories, popcorn, and bonding under the stars. They then deepened their skills at the Recruit Training Camp, learning to pitch tents, cook, and build scouting gadgets.

Mid-year, our scouts stepped up at the Scout Leadership Camp, both as participants and service scouts, sharpening their leadership. A major highlight was NPCXI—the first since 2018—where eight scouts represented us with pride, showcasing their camping and pioneering skills on the national stage.

They also took part in the National Day Parade at the Padang and our school’s own parade, showing their pride and dedication. Over eight sessions, they explored sea sports like kayaking and dragon boating, building confidence and a spirit of adventure.

Scouts also competed in the Orienteering Competition and South Area Cook Off, and joined events like the Adiji, Istana Open House, and International Friendship Fiesta.

To top it all off, five scouts earned the prestigious Chief Commissioner’s Award—proof of their hard work and commitment.
Here’s to another incredible year of growth, fun, and friendship!
