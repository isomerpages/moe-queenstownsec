Scouts (Sea)
============

## **The Quest to...**

•	**The Quest to Spread the 03 Spirit**

The 03 spirit stands for loyalty, excellence in scouting, and personal growth. We strive to spread this spirit through friendship, positivity, and staying true to our troop and the scouting movement. Every 03 scout is an ambassador of this spirit—embracing teamwork, leadership, discipline, and respect for each other’s unique identities.
Our flag, raised at every meeting, proudly symbolizes our independence and heritage. “03” reflects our position as the third scout troop in Singapore, “1903” marks our district code, and the cog represents Queenstown Secondary’s past as a Technical School. The World Scout emblem reminds us of our shared global journey and where we come from.
