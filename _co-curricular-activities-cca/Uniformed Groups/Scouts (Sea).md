2023 was a busy and exciting year for our scouts. The Sec 1s were introduced to scouting during the Sec 1 Experience where they enjoyed popcorn while listening to scouting stories by the campfire. During the Recruit Training Camp, the scouts had an opportunity to bond over camping in tents, cooking together and building gadgets. This year our scouts experienced a physical leadership camp at Sarimbun and attended campfires, gangshows and other regular scouting activities. Our scouts also spent eight sessions at Sentosa honing their skills with the various sea sports offered. Queenstown Secondary hosted the South Area Field Day and the units that came all enjoyed themselves tremendously taking part in the games. There were tours to Navy@Vivo, Changi Naval Base and also the Farewell to our Chief Scout President Halimah. And last but not least, we had a bumper crop of seven scouts who achieved the Chief Commisioner’s Award this year.
