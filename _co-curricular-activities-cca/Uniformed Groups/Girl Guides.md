Girl Guides
===========


**Highlights of the Year**
----------------------------------
At South Division Day, our girls demonstrated
their creativity and leadership by designing a
custom patch. Additionally, a group of Guides
designed and led mindfulness exercises for
students from other schools, encouraging
self-care and emotional well-being in their
peers. 

This yearâ€™s National Day Parade was another
highlight, where our Guides proudly
participated, contributing to the spirit of
national pride and unity. Their involvement
in such an important event deepened their
sense of responsibility and connection to the
nation.

Perhaps the most memorable event of the
year was the Guides 3D2N Camp, the first held in four years since the COVID-19 pandemic. This student-led camp was a testament to the leadership and organisational skills of our goals. Each level took on a distinct role in planning the camp activities: Secondary 1 students organized morning exercises to build energy and teamwork; Secondary 2 students facilitated discussions on the UN Sustainable Development Goals, raising awareness of global issues; and Secondary 3 students took charge of organising the entire camp, ensuring it ran smoothly. This camp allowed the girls to develop teamwork, leadership, and event-planning skills while also reflecting on their role as global citizens.



**Key Achievements**
----------

A standout moment was World Thinking Day,
where five of our Sec 3 Guides were selected
as the Guard-of-Honour for the Opening
Ceremony, symbolizing their leadership
and dedication to the global Girl Guide
movement.
