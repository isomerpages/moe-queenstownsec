Basketball (Boys & Girls)
==========


**Highlights of the Year**
-------------------------------

This year saw the formation of our Girls’ Basketball Team, who bravely competed in the National School Games despite many being new to the sport. While the results were as expected, the team remained focused and determined to improve. To lay a strong foundation for the upcoming season, they concluded the year by participating in the BM Cup, leveraging the opportunity to refine their skills and bolster their confidence on the court.

**Key Achievements**
----------

For the Boys’ Basketball Team, the B Division made it to the quarter finals of the South Zone competition, demonstrating their teamwork and grit. Meanwhile, both C Division boys and girls took part in the new league format, competing in League 4 and League 3, respectively, and gained valuable experience on the court.
