**Highlights of the Year**
-------------------------------

Selected Secondary 2 and 3 boys also participated in the annual Youth Sports Symposium held
at Raffles Institution. They honed their leadership skills and learnt more about the principles of
training and sports nutrition from other student athletes.

## **Key Achievements**

The B boys trained hard and gave of their best during the B Div NSG to enable the school to maintain the Pool B status for 2025.

The C boys performed beyond expectation. Though they started in Pool E during the group stage, they fought hard, topped the group and moved up to League 4 in the preliminaries round and eventually did the school and themselves proud by achieving runners-up in the League 4 Championship knockout stage.
