<p><strong>Queenstown Secondary School: Passing the Technical Torch Through Seven Decades - Published by Zaobao in 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>Queenstown Secondary School, originally Queenstown Secondary Technical
School, was among Singapore's earliest technical institutions. Through
hands-on courses in woodwork and metalwork, it cultivated a skilled technical
workforce that powered the nation's industrial development. As the school
prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2026, Principal Sim How Chong
is rallying alumni across generations, hoping their stories of dedication
will keep the "technical" spirit alive for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Homecoming: Where Memories Never Fade</strong>
</p>
<p>Following a campus open day on 29 November, the school welcomed back alumni
spanning decades. Over a hundred former students gathered for a meal in
the familiar hall, wandered through old classrooms, and later hand-designed
clay tiles for a commemorative 70th-anniversary wall. This collaborative
artwork will adorn the staff room as a vibrant testament to their shared
legacy.</p>
<p><strong>The Technical School Era: A Forward-Looking Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Established in 1956 as Queenstown Secondary Technical School, the institution
was among Singapore's pioneering technical schools, alongside Tanjong Katong
Technical Secondary School. Both began as boys' schools with a bold vision.</p>
<p>陈维新, 86, was among the 92 students in the inaugural cohort. "Technical
schools were truly star institutions then," he recalled. "We learned industrial
drafting and developed hands-on skills in school workshops. With industrialisation
looming after the war, this was remarkably forward-looking education. I'd
already spent two years at an independent Chinese school but chose without
hesitation to restart from Secondary One here."</p>
<p>He added with evident pride: "While most schools followed the Cambridge
'O' Levels, technical schools adopted the London 'O' Levels, considered
more advanced at the time."</p>
<p>陈维新 remembered the school's first year as "very unsettled." The campus
wasn't ready, so students moved three times across three terms—between
two former primary school premises in Jalan Eunos and Mountbatten (both
since closed) and the newly built Tanjong Katong Technical Secondary School.
The school's workshop wasn't completed until his Secondary Three year,
meaning he missed the practical classes entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Building the Nation, One Skill at a Time</strong>
</p>
<p>陈佳材, 80, who enrolled in 1959, was among the first to experience workshop
classes. Students chose between woodwork and metalwork. "I chose metalwork
and made tools like vernier calipers," he said. "Woodwork students crafted
furniture—cabinets and the like."</p>
<p>Beyond technical subjects, the curriculum included English literature,
history, geography, mathematics, mechanical principles, and technical drawing.
陈维新 recalled with amusement that teacher shortages meant many instructors
attended evening classes at Singapore Polytechnic and taught secondary
students the next day. "The knowledge was fresh," he laughed.</p>
<p>After graduating in 1962, 陈佳材 enrolled in electronic engineering at Singapore
Polytechnic. Though financial constraints prevented completion, his technical
foundation enabled him to continuously upgrade his skills through Singapore's
technological transformation. He fondly remembered extracurricular life:
for just $4 monthly, he joined the sea scouts, boarded British warships,
participated in live-fire training using wooden crates as targets, and
played rugby. His outgoing nature led him to the debate team—skills that
later proved invaluable in his career as a printer industry salesperson,
where technical knowledge met communication prowess.</p>
<p>陈维新 noted that many alumni joined the Public Works Department and Public
Utilities Board after Singapore's independence in 1965, becoming key contributors
to nation-building. Notable graduates include former Minister for Trade
and Industry and Minister for Education Lee Yock Suan, and former Changi
Airport Group Chairman Liew Mun Leong.</p>
<p><strong>Evolution: From Technical School to Comprehensive Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Queenstown Secondary Technical School introduced pre-university classes
in 1965 to facilitate entry to Singapore Polytechnic. It began admitting
girls in 1971 and started offering both academic and technical streams
in 1993, when it was renamed Queenstown Secondary School.</p>
<p>赵慧玲, 50, who graduated in 1992, recalled the school's predominantly male
character. "There were five express classes, A to E. The first four were
all boys; only Class E was all girls. In the normal stream, Class F was
all boys, and my Class G was the only mixed-gender class. Perhaps there
weren't enough students, so they combined us," she laughed.</p>
<p>Despite the gender imbalance, school life thrived. Her most vivid memory
was a school-wide English musical adaptation of Thunderstorm, staged at
the Drama Centre in Dhoby Ghaut. "Everyone collaborated—from creation and
staging to promotion." She actively participated in the dance club, military
band, and liaison club, experiences that nurtured diverse interests that
shaped her life.</p>
<p><strong>Reconnecting Past, Present, and Future</strong>
</p>
<p>Principal Sim How Chong explained that the Queenstown Secondary Technical
School Alumni Association, established in 1977, was among the earliest
for government secondary schools. However, activities eventually waned.
"When I joined in 2022, I noticed many students were unaware of the school's
rich history. An active alumni association became essential as a bridge
connecting past, present, and future," he said. "A strong alumni network
helps students understand their heritage and allows graduates to continue
benefiting long after leaving school."</p>
<p>Under Sim's leadership, the school began welcoming younger alumni in batches
from 2023 and opened its doors to all alumni for the first time in 2025.
The 2026 celebration will feature the unveiling of the commemorative tile
wall and a refreshed school history corridor.</p>
<p>The school now collaborates with the alumni association on the Quest-Vantage
programme, which includes career and guidance education talks by alumni,
learning journeys to companies like Airbus, and job shadowing activities.
Secondary Two students interview alumni for history inquiry-based projects,
gaining understanding of both school and Singapore history through firsthand
accounts. "These interviews showcase how alumni proactively navigate life's
challenges and live out our school motto, 'Dare to Serve,'" Sim said. "These
life stories inspire students to carry forward this spirit."</p>
<p><strong>Pride in the Technical Legacy</strong>
</p>
<p>As one of the last graduates before the school's renaming, 赵慧玲 reflected:
"If I could choose, I wish the school hadn't changed its name. The word
'technical' might seem old-fashioned as times change, but it represents
our glory, our unique identity, and our sense of pride."

that lacked passion &amp; involvement in his studies, he was found to be
disinterested in computer related subjects. However, with constant encouragement
&amp; support from friends, family &amp; teachers his interest in studies
gradually grew &amp; he also wanted to become a computer expert like his
brother.</p>
<p>He was awarded the EDUSAVE excellence award for his generosity to help
various communities.</p>

for preparing food. He mentioned to Tamil Murasu, that recognition needs
to be given to these staffs that relentlessly serve us. He was appreciated
by many for his selfless character.</p>

exercises to his fellow students.</p>
<p>He said that his Mother, Grandmother, Grandfather, Younger Sister &amp;
older brother’s support played a vital role in him.</p>
<p>Especially his Grandmother used to encourage him to inculcate good characteristics
everyday.</p>
<p>In addition to this Emdhyas mentioned that without the constant support
&amp; patience of his teachers it wouldn’t have been possible for him to
achieve all that he has today. He said, he was forever grateful &amp; thankful
to them.</p>
<p>The governments support, his grandfather’s income &amp; the schools financial
assistance are the key players that helped him &amp; his family greatly.</p>
