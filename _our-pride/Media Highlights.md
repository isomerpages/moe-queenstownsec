in education and faced multiple challenges.</p>

studies in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>When he initially joined the Queenstown Secondary School he was a student
that lacked passion &amp; involvement in his studies, he was found to be
disinterested in computer related subjects. However, with constant encouragement
&amp; support from friends, family &amp; teachers his interest in studies
gradually grew &amp; he also wanted to become a computer expert like his
brother.</p>
<p>He was awarded the EDUSAVE excellence award for his generosity to help
various communities.</p>

everyday.</p>
<p>In addition to this Emdhyas mentioned that without the constant support
&amp; patience of his teachers it wouldn’t have been possible for him to
achieve all that he has today. He said, he was forever grateful &amp; thankful
to them.</p>
<p>The governments support, his grandfather’s income &amp; the schools financial
assistance are the key players that helped him &amp; his family greatly.</p>
