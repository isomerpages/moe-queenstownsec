<p>Our alumnus, Mr Ronald Goh, is Managing Director of Electronics and Engineering
(E&amp;E). Building on his family’s legacy, he embraces the unique challenges
that each light and sound installation presents. His company was involved
in the installation of light and sound systems for many large-scale projects,
including Esplanade Theatres on the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Theatres, GV
Max Dolby Atmos Cinema at VivoCity Shopping Centre and Changi Airport.</p>
<p>Under Mr Goh’s leadership, the company has evolved since its early days
in the cinema industry. While maintaining its commitment to innovation
in cinema sound, he has expanded the business to include videos and LED
walls. In a rapidly advancing technological landscape, he believes proactive
problem-solving, continuous learning from both successes and setbacks,
and adapting best practices are key elements for sustainable growth and
success. In 2015, his company was recognised and featured as one of the
Top 50 local companies that built our nation in the SG50 Tribute Edition
Book, which was published in conjunction with Singapore’s 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday
in 2015.
