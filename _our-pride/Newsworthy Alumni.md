<p>Our alumnus, Mr Ronald Goh, is Managing Director of Electronics and Engineering
(E&amp;E). Building on his family’s legacy, he embraces the unique challenges
that each light and sound installation presents. His company was involved
in the installation of light and sound systems for many large-scale projects,
including Esplanade Theatres on the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Theatres, GV
Max Dolby Atmos Cinema at VivoCity Shopping Centre and Changi Airport.</p>
<p>Under Mr Goh’s leadership, the company has evolved since its early days
in the cinema industry. While maintaining its commitment to innovation
in cinema sound, he has expanded the business to include videos and LED
walls. In a rapidly advancing technological landscape, he believes proactive
problem-solving, continuous learning from both successes and setbacks,
and adapting best practices are key elements for sustainable growth and
success. In 2015, his company was recognised and featured as one of the
Top 50 local companies that built our nation in the SG50 Tribute Edition
Book, which was published in conjunction with Singapore’s 50<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday
in 2015.

<p>Our alumnus, Mr Roland Wee, is the founder and chairman of the MEI Engineering
Group. An engineer by training, he designed and constructed sophisticated
facilities on a turnkey basis for many large multinational companies throughout
the Asia Pacific region since 1973.</p>
<p>He has also served on the Boards of Singapore PowerGas and subsidiaries
of DBS Land, and SembCorp.
<br>
<br>Mr Wee co-founded RWDC Industries Limited in 2015, a Singapore-based biotech
startup to develop fully biodegradable PHA polymers - a groundbreaking,
eco-friendly solution to save the planet and eliminate microplastics from
harming the human body.</p>
<p>When Mr Wee turned 80 in October 2024, he co-founded and launched the
Somatic Health Group that leverages AI-powered technologies for safety
and health rehabilitation for patients and around the globe. He says that
this is something that we can use for ourselves, for our friends, relatives
and society at large.</p>
<p>Driven by a deep commitment to giving back to society, Mr Wee has been
an active member of the Singapore Rotary Club for many years to support
charitable causes. As a Queen’s Scout and businessman, his guiding philosophy
is to leave this world a better, more peaceful and happier place for future
generations.
