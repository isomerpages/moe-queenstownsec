A recipient of multiple scholarships, Dr Tan is a veterinary surgeon with
more than 20 years of experience in the animal health industry.
<br>
<br>Since 2015, he has been recognised by the Royal College of Veterinary
Surgeons (RCVS, UK) as an Advanced Practitioner in Small Animal Practice
— a distinction held by only nine veterinarians globally, including just
two in the Asia-Pacific region as of July 2025. He was appointed to the
RCVS Panel of Assessors in 2019, where he evaluates advanced-level veterinarians
(at clinical master’s level and above) seeking recognition as Advanced
Practitioners. He has also served on the RCVS Academy Panel since 2022,
contributing to the development of professional training resources.
<br>
<br>Dr Tan has spoken at veterinary conferences across the Asia-Pacific region,

<p>Outside of veterinary medicine, Dr Tan is an award-winning composer whose
works have been performed by international ensembles and musicians. His
passion for the arts began early—at age six, he won Champion at the Singapore
National Chinese Language Storytelling Competition. He later won his first
organ-playing competition in 1992, and in 1995 received the Singapore National
Compositional Award for his original work. His compositions have been performed
internationally, including a 1996 premiere in Singapore by the Medici String
Quartet (UK).
<br>
<br>His most recent commission is a commemorative piece for the 120th Anniversary
of Goh Loo Club and Singapore’s 60th year of independence. Premiering on
6 July 2025 at the Arts House Chamber, the work — arranged by Associate
Professor Zhong Zhiyue of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music — is written
for guqin, sheng, and tenor soloist, a role Dr Tan will perform himself.
<br>
<br>Dr Tan has also served as a vocal coach and co-producer for the National
University of Singapore (NUS) Sheares Theatre, and has conducted various
choirs, including the National Junior College Choir — which competed at
the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in Wales — as well as the
King Edward VII Hall Choir and Sheares Hall Choir at NUS.
<br>
<br>His background in the arts has shaped his approach to veterinary care
— combining clinical precision with patience, empathy, and the sensitivity
of an artist.</p>
