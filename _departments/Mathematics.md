<h5><strong>The Quest to...</strong></h5>
<p>Develop every Queenstownian into an independent learner, and a precise
and resilient thinker.</p>
<h5><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h5>
<p><u>Using pedagogical practices in teaching towards Big Ideas in Mathematics:</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Diagrams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equivalence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invariance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proportionality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Solving Problems in Real World Context (PRWC) Tasks:</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Providing students with authentic context to work with to raise their
competencies in abstracting and reasoning, representing and communicating,
applying and modelling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Computational Thinking to approach PRWC questions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Teaching and Learning Practices</strong></h5>
<p>Our department adopted the ICAN (Improving Confidence and Numeracy) strategy,
guided by the core belief that all students can learn. ICAN addresses common
learning issues like gaps in understanding, motivation and memory. We use
Explicit and Direct Instruction to build foundational knowledge, focusing
on Routines and Norms, Confidence and Motivation and Scaffolding and Progression.
Through this structured support, we aim to enhance students' confidence
and help them build numeracy skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further improve students' confidence in mathematics, the department
believes in creating ‘bite-sized successes’. The ipsative assessment approach
allows students to track their progress over time, focusing on personal
improvement rather than comparison with others. This empowers students
to see their growth, reinforcing a positive learning mindset.</p>
<p>Additionally, the department adopted a computational thinking strategy
using flowcharts to help students unpack complex questions. This approach
guides students through a systematic process of breaking down problems
into manageable steps and clarifying methods.</p>
<p>By integrating these strategies, our department aims to build students'
confidence, enhance their problem-solving abilities, and foster a deeper
understanding of mathematical concepts.</p>
