<p></p>
<p>In QTSS, we place the holistic well-being of our students at the centre
and focus on 5 different domains to enhance their well-being. Our framework
is premised on Positive Psychology and the five building blocks of the
PERMA Model by Martin Seligman (<strong>P</strong>ositive Emotions, <strong>E</strong>ngagement, <strong>R</strong>elationships, <strong>M</strong>eaning, <strong>A</strong>ccomplishment).</p>
<p><strong>Engaging Total Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school’s total curriculum engages
the students in meaningful learning activities, instilling in them, the
disposition to learn for life as well as equipping them with the knowledge,
skills and 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies to thrive in the future.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE) lessons provide the platform for CMs to conduct school-based programmes
e.g. Growth Mindset and just-in-time well-being packages.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Right and Finish Strong Programmes
are facilitated at the start and end of each term to help students set
goals and review their progress.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Student Voice &amp; Choice</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students are active participants
in their own learning and well-being. Their perspectives and interests
are used to actively shape their school experiences, engendering student
agency.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://staging.d33coz43hxnqna.amplifyapp.com/student-voices/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Student Voice</a> is
a digital platform to encourage student voice for school matters and helping
them feel connected and valued in the school.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Positive Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regular Quest Check-ins are conducted
to build positive Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peer support and networks are also
strengthened within and beyond the class to foster a deeper sense of belonging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Safe and Inclusive Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Student surveys e.g. well-being
and check -in surveys and social network analysis are administered regularly
to understand the needs and emotional state of students as well as understand
peer relationships within the class.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class of Excellence (COE) Challenge
helps to nurture a positive class culture for learning and affirm classes
which have performed well.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diverse student needs are supported
and students are empowered through opportunities to pursue their passions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Partnership</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Families and communities collaborate
as partners with the school to support student learning, safety and well-being.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parent Engagement sessions and Parent-Teacher
Meetings are organised to communicate level outcomes and focus at each
level and to inform parents of the academic progress of students.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school also leverages external
agencies e.g. Family Service Centres to complement school’s support for
students.</p>

<p><strong>Targeted Support and Intervention</strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>School Counselling:</strong>
</p>
<p>Counselling is a collaborative process in which the school counsellor
facilitates the expansion of the student’s view of life, enlarges his/her
repertoire of coping resources and enables him/her to make choices for
change in himself/herself, the situation and the environment, without destructive
consequences to self or others. Students who experience difficulties in
issues such as academic stress, anxiety, peer or family relationships may
be referred for counselling support.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Student Welfare:</strong>
</p>
<p>Introduced in 2015, Student Welfare Officer (SWO) supports vulnerable
students whose schooling is affected by disadvantaged backgrounds. SWO
reaches out to students who are irregular in school and helps to reintegrate
chronic absentees back to school. Community resources are often mobilised
to mitigate the risks and support the needs of the students and their families.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Special Educational Needs:</strong>
</p>
<p>Special Educational Needs Officers (SENO) support students with special
educational needs (SEN). They provide targeted learning and behaviour support
through individual or small group intervention and/or skills training and/or
in-class support based on the needs of students with SEN. Their support
is invaluable in enabling students to achieve their goals. In addition,
they reach out to families of students with SEN to build home-school partnerships
and strengthen the support for students.</p>
