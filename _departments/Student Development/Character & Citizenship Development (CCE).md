##### **Key Approaches**


<img src="/images/ccekey.png" style="width:6![](/images/peer22.png)0%">


The Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) programmes in QTSS emphasises on the school’s core values and aims to strengthen the competencies of Queenstownians so that they will be able to make sound decisions, therein fostering meaningful and positive relationship with others, and making a positive impact to the community around them.

Through the different content areas in the CCE curriculum, Queenstownians go through a journey to make sense of the ever-changing world around them: 

<ul>
	<li> This journey brings them progressively through the years to explore their identity and role in the world as an individual and a member of the community, and eventually one where they impact the community.
	</li><li> This progressive approach ensures that the materials will be relatable to them at every stage of their life in QTSS. 
  </li><li> Their appreciation of the conversations they have in class are reinforced when these conversations and learnings extend to every aspect of a Queenstownians’ life within QTSS, with elements of CCE being weaved into every learning experience and teachable moments.   
</li>
</ul>


True to our philosophy, where the unique worth of every individual is cherished, and the symbiotic relation between him/her and society is recognised, we place much emphasis on the involvement of every Queenstownian in their own development and influence on others:

<ul> 
	<li> Students are strongly encouraged to contribute their voices in classroom discussions as well as other areas 
where they are able to apply what they learnt during CCE. 
	</li><li> Positive relationships between them and their peers and staff are also nurtured and sustained, which goes a long way in helping our Queenstownians internalise the multiple facets of their Character and Citizenship Education.
				
</li>
</ul>
		


**<u>Student-centric Programmes </u>**

<ul>
<li>Equipping students with the necessary head knowledge regarding values, skills and competencies to become a better version of themselves <br>
</li><li>Providing students with safe and authentic learning experiences to make sense of the world around them and apply their knowledge <br>
</li><li>Giving students the opportunities to internalize their learning
</li>
</ul>


The programmes are conducted in partnership with the other stakeholders in and outside of school, to enable  Queenstownians to enjoy a positive and meaningful relationship with others in the community.

**<u><a style="color: inherit" name="test2">Student Leadership</a></u>** <br>

Anchored in the belief that every learner can be a leader and should be a leader, the Student Leadership Development programme in QTSS constantly seeks to provide opportunities where Queenstownians hone their self-mastery in leadership qualities, with the eventual goal of addressing society’s current and future needs.
Learners who demonstrate competency in self-mastery, with an inclination towards peer influence and community leadership, are identified and provided with training opportunities to develop and hone peer leadership skills. This takes the form of mentoring by teacher-mentors, workshops as well as platforms to interact and network with student leaders from other schools in a bid to develop our student leaders into “Ready supporters with courage”. On top of that, to realise the outcome of “Visionary Advocators with wisdom”, selected student leaders are presented with opportunities to conceptualise, plan and execute cohort to school-wide events such as CYL activities, Orientation Camp, Youth Day, Teachers’ Day, and being advocators of students’ voice.
The Student Leadership Development Programme in QTSS aspires to equip all our learners with the skills and knowledge to continue soaring high and help others soar in the face of challenges posed by the unknown future.


**<u><a style="color: inherit" name="test">Peer Support &amp; Relations</a></u>**<br>
Recognising the role that quality relationships plays in ensuring the readiness of our Queenstownians to learn and grow, QTSS invests significant resources in strengthening the Peer Support Programmes. Queenstownians are equipped with knowledge in the 3 domains of peer support – Peer Bonding, Peer Helping and Peer Influencing – and opportunities are provided to allow for the development of positive relationships between the peers. The presence of positive relationships creates a strong culture of care which ensures that Queenstownians feel a greater sense of belonging and therein being more resilient in navigating the challenges.
While all Queenstownians play a part in providing basic peer support to one another, those who are deemed to demonstrate a stronger disposition in showing empathy and caring for others are identified and trained with additional knowledge and skills to effect the 3 domains of peer support. This group of Queenstownians will be charged with being the champions of strengthening the caring culture in QTSS, and influencing their peers and juniors to promote positive mindset and mental well-being both online and offline. A safe and caring community where every Queenstownian feels accepted and supported, is one where Queenstownians will then flourish and grow to be future-ready.
