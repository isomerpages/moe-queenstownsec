<h1>Physical Education</h1>
<h5><strong>The Quest to…</strong></h5>
<p>Develop every Queenstownian into a physically competent and confident
individual who enjoys living an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<h5><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h5>
<p>Building students’ appreciation and regular participation in recreational
and physical activities, thereby empowering them to live a healthy and
active lifestyle. Students learn to do so via:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fitness Tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games Assessment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem Diagnosis Framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making Think Visible with e-Pedagogy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Teaching and Learning Experiences</strong></h5>
<p>Our physical education program prioritises personalized, inclusive, and
skill-building experiences. Differentiated instruction and educational
technology tools enable students to learn and progress at their own pace,
while adaptive PE tools, including modified rules and equipment, ensure
accessibility for students of all abilities.
<br>
<br>Through peer-led activities, team reflection, and feedback using the Sport
Education Model and the Learn-Do-Reflect cycle, students develop leadership,
empathy, and teamwork, which results in them taking greater ownership of
their learning. Exposure to diverse sports and games encourages personal
interests, independence, and a lasting commitment to wellness.</p>
