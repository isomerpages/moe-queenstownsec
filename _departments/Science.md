<h1>Science</h1>
<h5><strong>The Quest to…</strong></h5>
<p>Develop every Queenstownian into a confident, creative and motivated learner.</p>
<h5><strong>Key Approaches</strong></h5>
<p>The three “IN”s, inspire, inquire and innovate, represent the <strong>vision of science education.</strong> It
encapsulates the desired overall experience of our students in science
education.</p>
<p><u>INspired by Science</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enjoying learning Science, and being fascinated by how everyday phenomena
have scientific connections and how Science helps solve many of our global
challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regarding Science as relevant and meaningful, and appreciating how Science
and Technology have transformed the world and improved our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing Science-related careers as a viable profession to serve the good
of society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>INquire like Scientists</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Having a strong foundation in Science, and possessing the spirit of scientific
inquiry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging confidently in the Practices of Science, grounded in the knowledge,
issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily
life, society and the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discerning, weighing alternatives and evaluating claims and ideas critically,
based on logical scientific evidence and arguments, and yet being able
to suspend judgement where there is lack of evidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u>INnovate using Science</u>
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Applying and experiencing the potential of Science to generate creative
solutions to solve real-world problems, ranging from those affecting everyday
lives to complex problems affecting humanity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making contributions towards STEM research, innovation and enterprise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Teaching and Learning Practices</strong></h5>
<p>With science and technology increasingly present in our everyday lives,
it is critical for our students to be able to weigh alternatives and evaluate
claims<strong> </strong>that are related to their lives based on scientific
evidence, while suspending judgement where evidence is lacking. Inquiry-based
learning<strong> </strong>continues to be our main pedagogical approach
in Science and it is used pervasively in our Science lessons and Applied
Learning Programme.</p>
<p>Through our Science lessons, we engage students in relevant and meaningful
science learning experiences that help them appreciate how science and
technology has the potential to improve lives. In doing so, we also help
our students keep an open mind about Science as being useful for their
daily lives and a viable profession that serves the good of society. In
summary, we aim to inspire our students about the possibilities and the
pursuit of Science. Beyond the classroom, exposure to various enrichment
programmes like learning journeys and work attachment help increase students’
level of engagement in their learning of Science.</p>
