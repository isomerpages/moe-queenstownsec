<h5><strong>Teaching and Learning Practices</strong></h5>
<p>The ICT department seeks to integrate ICT into curriculum, pedagogy and
assessment of subject disciplines. The design of ICT-enriched learning
experiences provides opportunities for students to engage in collaborative
learning, research and acquire 21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies. In
designated prototype classrooms, teachers experiment with technologies
such as Virtual Reality to make learning immersive, interactive, and effective.</p>

<p>Secondary 1 National Digital Explorer Programme: All Secondary 1 students
participate in the National Digital Explorer (NDE) initiative. NDE is a
nationwide digital literacy initiative designed to empower students to
learn real-world skills that enable them to think critically and be more
productive learners. As part of this initiative, students are equipped
with key skills and knowledge on the effective use of office productivity
tools. They will then be able to apply the skills learnt in various curricular
and co-curricular projects throughout their Secondary school journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 2 Video Creation: In Secondary 2, students are exposed to storyboarding
and video creation tools. Subsequently, for their Community Youth Leadership
project, they will create videos to document and showcase their CYL journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondary 3 e-Portfolio Creation: All Secondary 3 students undergo a workshop
where they learn how to build their own website using Google Sites and
the suite of tools designed to empower students to harness their creativity.
Students build their digital portfolio, documenting their skills and competencies
and then showcase their products. The digital portfolio helps students
be successful with their Early Admissions Exercise applications for tertiary
education.</p>
