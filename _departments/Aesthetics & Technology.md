<h5><strong>Teaching and Learning Practices</strong>&nbsp;</h5>
<p>The A&amp;T Department adopted the experiential learning (Learning by
Doing) pedagogical approach to allow learners to assimilate concepts through
putting into practice what they have learnt. This process encourages the
students to develop a growth mindset by actively learning from their mistakes
and reflecting on their learning. At the same time, teachers guide and
stretch individual learners based on their strength and readiness to learn,
bringing out the best in the students.</p>
