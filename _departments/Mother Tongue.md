<h3><strong>Teaching and Learning Practices</strong></h3>
<p>To inspire a love of learning and develop students into active learners
and proficient users of their Mother Tongue Language (MTL), cultural appreciation
is integrated into lessons, developing a deeper connection to and understanding
of students’ cultural heritage. One key event is the MTL Fortnight activities,
which offer hands-on, experiential learning that cultivates an appreciation
for different cultures. For example, when writing expository essays on
the topic of ‘Chinese Tea’, students explore cultural aspects of Chinese
medicine, such as sewing a traditional herbal sachet and using dried orange
peel to repel insects and energise themselves. This experience is an opportunity
for students to reflect on both the process and the cultural significance,
and learn that traditional Chinese medicinal practices and values emphasise
the importance of well-being and having a harmonious relationship with
the environment.</p>
<p>Using e-Pedagogy, teachers tap on a range of multimedia resources to complement
traditional classroom learning. The use of ICT tools further promote students’
learning by enhancing their understanding and ecouraging critical thinking:
word clouds capture students’ initial thoughts, Padlet allows students
to be engaged in meaningful discussions, and spreadsheets support students’
monitoring of their learning. Together, these approaches bring vibrancy
and depth to the learning of MTL.</p>
