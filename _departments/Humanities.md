<h5><strong>Teaching and Learning Practices</strong></h5>
<p>Inquiry-based learning is the main pedagogical practice used by all units
in the Humanities Department. In Social Studies, students are exposed to
varied global and societal issues. Through classroom discussions, and leveraging
on the affordances of ICT tools such as Classpoint and Padlet, students
learn and appreciate the multiple perspectives on a particular societal
issue. This has enabled them to make their thinking and learning more visible.
Other than inquiry-based learning, another teaching practice is field-based
learning. Geography field studies and History learning journeys provided
opportunities for our students to relate what they have learnt in the textbook
to the world around them. One example is the Sec 1 Geographical investigation
to Pierce reservoir to study about the water quality as well as the natural
environment in the reservoir.</p>
