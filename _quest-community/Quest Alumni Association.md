<h3><strong>Inception / History</strong></h3>
<p>The QUEST Alumni was founded by the pioneer batch of 1959 and it has held
strong till this present day.</p>
<p>The Alumni was officially registered in 1977, making it one of the earliest
Alumni of any local secondary school, apart from the colonial era schools.
Our pioneering Alumni are the pillars of the nation building days, helping
to shape the nation’s success that we know today.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Goals</strong></h3>
<p>To build an inclusive network of Alumni based on the spirit of Dare to
Serve to support the students, co-create opportunities for our members
and to improve lives in the community.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Alumni</strong></h3>
<p>The Alumni offers a broad network and global reach for career, social
or advisory to peers and students. Many of our Alumni are shining luminaries
in our society. They hold leadership positions in the corporate, government,
social sectors. Several Ministers and Civil Service Leaders have emerged
from this humble school, reflecting the good foundation and grounded values
that has shaped their pathway to success. There are also those who built
their own business legacy through hard work, diligence and sheer perseverance,
and eked out their own success stories from humble beginnings. Within our
ever-growing Alumni base of more than 20,000, many are corporate highflyers,
community champions, ambassadors for social causes, selflessly giving back
to the School and the Alumni to uplift the students’ lives and give a hand
to the less fortunate amongst us. The Alumni has worked hand in hand with
the School to support and improve the lives and journey of the students,
helping to nurture talents of the future. Last but not least, a Queenstown
Alumni never refuses the opportunity to come back and support our Alma
Mater School, continuing the legacy left by our pioneers - Dare to Serve
- for School, for Members, for Community.</p>
<h3><strong>The Alumnus Pledge</strong><br><br>I strive to be the best that I can be, to serve the Alumni, the School, the Quest Community and our Society.</h3>
