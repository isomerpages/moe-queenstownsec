Info on DMA Option A
====================

Information on Device Management Application (DMA)
--------------------------------------------------

### What is the purpose of a DMA?

Device Management Application (DMA), is a software solution to allow schools to provide a safer digital environment for learning. With DMA installed on the Personal Learning Device (PLD), schools can:

*   Set the level of web content filtering , including filtering out objectionable content or content that may not be conducive to teaching and learning (e.g. social media, pornography, gambling, or websites containing extremist content)
*   Set PLD usage timing, limiting usage from 0700hrs to 2300hrs daily
*   Individual school can determine the apps and software to be installed to support teaching and learning needs.

###   What flexibilities do I get in Option A?

With Default option, students will login to their PLD using _Student ICON Account_, this account can be access during school hours from 7am to 11pm and is configured with school approved applications only. The web content filtering is also activated when students are using this account. To provide a more focus and conducive learning experience, Default options will only allow students to login using this account.

For Option A, two additional accounts have been created on the PLD to facilitate the following flexibilities:

#### Student After-School Hours Account

_After School Hours_, from 3pm and up till 11pm, your child/ward may login to their PLD using the _Student After-School Hours Account_. School will not have control over this account. This account allow students to run and install applications on their PLD. Do note that some application and features may still need an administrator rights to run or install, in these cases, you will have to grant access using the _Parent Admin Account_ provided.

#### Parent Admin Account

The _Parent Admin Account_ is meant for parents/guardian only. This account will allow you to gain full control over the PLD and you can install applications of choice and customize your child’s/ward’s device, while retaining the web filtering function to protect your child/ward from unsafe contents. You are advised not to:

*   Share the Parent Admin Account password with your child/ward,
*   Remove applications that have been installed by the school (e.g Chrome and Blocksi), and
*   De-enroll the PLD from Intune for Education.

In addition to these two accounts that is created in your child’s/ward’s device, there is an online account for monitoring online activities.

#### Blocksi DMA Parent Portal Account

This online account allows you to view your child’s/ward’s online activities when they are using their PLD. You will receive an invitation email from Blocksi to setup _Blocksi DMA Parent Portal Account_. (Do check your spam/junk folder if you do not see it in your Inbox.)

### How do I start using Option A for the DMA?

To start using the option A, you will need to do some setup.  We have send  via Parents Gateway or email with the necessary information and a PDF guide. Please note that the PDF guide is meant for Parents/Guardians, therefore we do not have a link to the document publicly. This guide contains instructions on:
